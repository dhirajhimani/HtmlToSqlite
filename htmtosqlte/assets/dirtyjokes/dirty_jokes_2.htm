            <p>Construction worker on the 5th floor of a
            building needed a handsaw. So he spots another worker on the ground
            floor and yells down to him, but he can't hear him. So the worker on
            the 5th floor tries sign language.</p>
            <p>He pointed to his eye meaning &quot;I&quot;,
            pointed to his knee meaning &quot;need&quot;, then moved his hand
            back and forth in a hand saw motion. The man on the ground floor
            nods his head, pulls down his pants, whips out his chop and starts
            masturbating.</p>
            <p>The worker on 5th floor gets so pissed off he
            runs down to the ground floor and says, &quot;What the fuck is your
            problem!!! I said I needed a hand saw!&quot;.</p>
            <p>The other guy says, &quot;I knew that! I was
            just trying to tell you - I'm coming!&quot;</p>

            <p>One day an at home wife is alone and the
            doorbell rings.</p>
            <p>She opens it to a guy, &quot;Hi, is Tony
            home?&quot;</p>
            <p>The wife replies, &quot;No, he went to the
            store, but you can wait here if you want.&quot;</p>
            <p>So they sit down and after a while of silence
            the friend says &quot;You know Sara, you have the greatest breasts I
            have ever seen. I'd give you a hundred buck just to see one.&quot;</p>
            <p>Sara thinks about it for a second and figures,
            what the hell - a hundred bucks! She opens her robe and shows one to
            him for a few seconds. He promptly thanks her and throws a hundred
            bucks on the table. They sit there a while longer and guy then says
            &quot;That was so amazing I've got to see both of them. I'll give
            you another 100 dollars if I could just see the both of them
            together.&quot;</p>
            <p>Sara amazed by the offer sits and thinks a bit
            about it and thinks, heck, why not? So she opens her robe and gives
            Chris a nice long chance to cop a look.</p>
            <p>A while later Tony arrives back home from the
            store. The wife goes up to him, &quot;You know, your friend Chris
            came over.&quot;</p>
            <p>Tony thinks about it for a second and says,
            &quot;Well did he drop off the 200 bucks he owes me?&quot;</p>

            <p>A kindergarten teacher one day is trying to
            explain to her class the definition of the word
            &quot;definitely&quot; to them. To make sure the students have a
            good understanding of the word, she asks them to use it in a
            sentence. The first student raised his hand and said &quot;The sky
            is definitely blue&quot;. The teacher said, &quot;Well, that isn't
            entirely correct, because sometimes it's gray and cloudy&quot;.</p>
            <p>Another student says, &quot;Grass is
            definitely green.&quot; The teacher again replies &quot;If grass
            doesn't get enough water it turns brown, so that isn't really
            correct either.&quot;</p>
            <p>Another student raises his hand and asks the
            teacher &quot;Do farts have lumps?&quot; The teacher looked at him
            and said &quot;No...But that isn't really a question you want to ask
            in class discussion.&quot; So the student replies, &quot;Then I
            definitely shit my pants.&quot;</p>

            <p>Wife : &quot;I dreamt they were auctioning off

            <p>Husband : &quot;How about the ones like
            mine?&quot;</p>
            <p>Wife : &quot;Those they gave away.&quot;</p>
            <p>Husband : &quot;I had a dream too...I dreamt
            they were auctioning off cunts. The pretty ones went for a thousand
            dollars, and the little tight ones went for two thousand.&quot;</p>
            <p>Wife : &quot;And how much for the ones like
            mine?&quot;</p>
            <p>Husband : &quot;That's where they held the

            <p>The queen of England was visiting one of
            Canada's top hospitals, and during her tour of the floors she passed
            a room where a male patient was masturbating.</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh my god!&quot;, said the Queen,
            &quot;That's disgraceful, what is the meaning of this???&quot;</p>
            <p>The doctor leading the tour explains,
            &quot;I'm sorry your ladyship, this man has a very serious condition
            where the testicles rapidly fill with semen. If he doesn't do that
            five times a day, they would explode and he would most likely die
            instantly.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh, I am sorry&quot; said the Queen.</p>
            <p>On the next floor they passed a room where a
            young nurse was giving a patient a blow job.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh my God&quot;, said the Queen, &quot;What's happening in
            there?&quot;</p>
            <p>The Doctor replied, &quot;Same problem, better

            <p>A little boy and his grandfather are raking
            leaves in the yard. The little boy sees an earthworm trying to get
            back into its hole. He says, &quot;Grandpa, I bet I can put that
            worm back in that hole.&quot; The grandfather replies, &quot;I'll
            bet you five dollars you can't. It's too wiggly and limp to put back
            in that little hole.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The little boy runs into the house and comes back out with a can of
            hair spray. He sprays the worm until it is straight and stiff as a
            board. The boy then proceeds to put the worm back into the hole. The
            grandfather hands the little boy five dollars, grabs the hair spray
            and runs into the house.<br />
            <br />
            Thirty minutes later the grandfather comes back out and hands the
            boy another five dollars. The little boy says, &quot;Grandpa, you
            already gave me five dollars.&quot; The grandfather replies, &quot;I
            know. That's from your Grandma.&quot;</p>

            <p>Dirty Little Matt is sitting in the back of

            calls his name.</p>
            <p>&quot;Yeah teach?&quot; he replies.</p>

            <p>Matt answers &quot;Well, teach, if I shoot one
            of them with a shotgun, the loud noise is gonna make them all fly
            off.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;No, Matt, there will be two left if you
            shoot one with a shotgun, but I like the way you're thinking.&quot;
            the teacher responds.</p>
            <p>&quot;Well, teach, I've got a question for
            you... There are 3 women that come out of an ice-cream parlor, one
            is biting her ice-cream cone, one is licking it, and one is sucking
            on it. Which one is married?&quot;</p>
            <p>The teacher, a little taken back by the
            question answers, &quot;Well, uh, gee Matt, I guess the one that's
            sucking on the ice cream.&quot;</p>
            <p>Matt replies &quot;No teach, the one that has
            the wedding ring on her finger, but I like the way you're

            They also couldn't afford to go on a honeymoon so they all stayed
            home with their new hubbies. That night the mother got up because
            she couldn't sleep.</p>
            <p>When she went past her oldest daughter's room

            <p>&quot;That's true.&quot; She looked at her

            <p>A depressed young woman was so desperate that
            she decided to end her life by throwing herself into the ocean. When
            she went down to the docks, a handsome young sailor noticed her
            tears, took pity on her, and said, &quot;Look, you've got a lot to
            live for. I'm off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can
            stow you away on my ship. I'll take good care of you and bring you
            food every day.&quot; Moving closer, he slipped his arm around her
            shoulder and added, &quot;I'll keep you happy, and you'll keep me
            happy.&quot;</p>
            <p>The girl nodded yes, after all, what did she
            have to lose? That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her
            in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought her three
            sandwiches and a piece of fruit, and they made passionate love until
            dawn.</p>
            <p>Three weeks later, during a routine search,
            she was discovered by the captain. 'What are you doing here?' the
            captain asked. She got up off the ground and explained, &quot;I have
            an arrangement with one of the sailors. He's taking me to Europe,
