      <p>A young woman was having a physical examination and 
      was very embarrassed because of a weight problem. As she removed her last 
      bit of clothing, she blushed. &quot;I'm so ashamed, Doctor,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess 
      I let myself go.&quot; The physician was checking hers eyes and ears. &quot;Don't 
      feel ashamed, Miss. You don't look that bad.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Do you really think so, Doctor?&quot; she asked. The doctor held a tongue 
      depressor in front of her face and said, &quot;Of course. Now just open your 
      mouth and say moo.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A handsome young lad went into the hospital for some 
      minor surgery, and the day after the procedure a friend stopped by to see 
      how the guy was doing. His friend was amazed at the number of nurses who 
      entered the room in short intervals with refreshments, offers to fluff his 
      pillows, make the bed, give back rubs, etc. &quot;Why all the attention?&quot; the 
      friend asked, &quot;You look fine to me.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;I know!&quot; grinned the patient. &quot;But the nurses kind of formed a little fan 
      club when they all heard that my circumcision required twenty-seven 
      stitches.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
      <p>Charlie marries a virgin. On their wedding night, 
      he's on fire, so he gets naked, jumps into bed, and immediately begins 
      groping her. &quot;Charles, I expect you to be as mannerly in bed as you are at 
      the dinner table.&quot; So, Charlie folds his hands on his lap and says, &quot;Is 
      this better?&quot; &quot;Much better!&quot; she replies with a smile. &quot;Okay, then,&quot; he 
      says, &quot;now will you please pass the pussy.&quot;</p>
      <hr />
      <p>A farmer was driving along the road with a load of 
      fertilizer. A little boy, playing in front of his house, saw him and 
      called, &quot;What've you got in your truck?&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Fertilizer,&quot; the farmer replied. &quot;What are you going to do with it?&quot; 
      asked the little boy. <br />
      <br />
      &quot;Put it on strawberries,&quot; answered the farmer. &quot;You ought to live here,&quot; 
      the little boy advised him. &quot;We put sugar and cream on ours.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. 
      Shortly afterward, she told him she was pregnant. Not wanting his wife to 
      know, he gave the nurse a sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and 
      have the baby there. &quot;But how will I let you know the baby is born?&quot; she 
      asked. He replied, &quot;Just send me a postcard and write 'spaghetti' on the 
      back. I'll take care of expenses.&quot; Not knowing what else to do, the nurse 
      took the money and flew to Italy. <br />
      <br />
      Six months went by and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the 
      office and explained, &quot;Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the 
      mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means.&quot; The doctor 
      said, &quot;Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you.&quot; <br />
      <br />
      Later that evening, the doctor came home, read the postcard, fell to the 
      floor with a heart<br />
      attack. Paramedics rushed him to the ER. The lead medic stayed back to 
      comfort the wife. <br />
      He asked what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest. So the wife 
      picked up the card and read, &quot;'Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti 
      - Two with sausage and meatballs, two without.'&quot;</p>
            <hr />
      <p>The doctor said, &quot;Joe, the good news is I can cure 
      your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have 
      a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, 
      and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve 
      the pressure is to remove the testicles.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. 
      He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no 
      choice but to go under the knife.<br />
      <br />
      When he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 
      20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As 
      he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different 
      person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's 
      clothing store &amp; thought, &quot;That's what I need - a new suit.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      He entered the shop and told the salesman, &quot;I'd like a new suit.&quot; The 
      elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, &quot;Let's see ... size 44 long.&quot; 
      Joe laughed, &quot;That's right, how did you know?&quot; &quot;Been in the business 60 
      years!&quot; Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly.<br />
      <br />
      As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, &quot;How about a new 
      shirt?&quot; Joe thought for a moment and then said, &quot;Sure.&quot; The salesman eyed 
      Joe and said, &quot;Let's see, 34 sleeve &amp; 16-1/2 neck.&quot; Again, Joe was 
      surprised, &quot;That's right, how did you know?&quot; &quot;Been in the business 60 
      years!&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar 
      in the mirror, the salesman asked, &quot;How about new shoes?&quot; Joe was on a 
      roll and said, &quot;Sure.&quot; The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, &quot;Let's see 
      ... 9-1/2 E.&quot; Joe was astonished, &quot;That's right, how did you know?&quot; &quot;Been 
      in the business 60 years!&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably 
      around the shop and the salesman asked, &quot;How about some new underwear?&quot; 
      Joe thought for a second and said, &quot;Sure.&quot; The salesman stepped back, eyed 
      Joe's waist and said, &quot;Let's see... size 36.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Joe laughed. &quot;Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years 
      old.&quot; The salesman shook his head, &quot;You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 
      underwear would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and 
      give you one hell of a headache.</p>

      <p>A precious little girl walks into a pet shop and 
      asks in the sweetest little lisp, &quot;Excuthe me, mithter, do you keep widdle 
      wabbits?&quot; As the shopkeeper's heart melts, he gets down on his knees, so 
      that he's on her level, and asks, &quot;Do you want a widdle white wabby or a 
      thoft and fuwwy bwack wabby or maybe one like that cute widdle bwown wabby 
      over there?&quot; She, in turn blushes, rocks on her heels, puts her hands on 
      her knees, leans forward and says in a quiet voice, &quot;I don't fink my pet 
      python weally gives a thit.</p>

            <p>A young couple were on their way to Vegas to get 
      married. Before getting there, the girl said to the guy that she had a 
      confession to make. The reason that they have not been too intimate is 
      because she is very flat chested. <br />
      <br />
      &quot;If you want to cancel the wedding, then I'll understand,&quot; she said. The 
      guy remarked, &quot;I don't mind that you're flat, and sex is not the most 
      important thing in a marriage anyway.&quot; <br />
      <br />
      Several miles down the road, the guy turned to the girl and said that he 
      also had a confession to make. The reason that they have not been too 
      intimate is because he is just like a baby below the waist. The girl 
      remarked, &quot;I don't mind that like a baby below the <br />
      waist, and sex is not the most important thing in a marriage anyway.&quot; <br />
      <br />
      And so, the happy couple went on to Vegas and got married. On their 
      wedding night, the girl took off her clothes. True to her word, she is as 
      flat as a washboard. Then, the guy took <br />
      off his clothes. After one glance at his naked body, the girl fainted and 
      fell to the floor. <br />
      <br />
      When she regained consciousness, the guy said, &quot;I told you before we got 
      married, so why were you so surprised?&quot; <br />
      <br />
      &quot;You told me it was just like a baby.&quot; The guy replied, &quot;It is! 8 pounds 
      and 21 inches long!&quot;</p>

            <p>A young female teacher was giving her class of six 
      year olds a quiz &quot;behind my back I've got something red, round and you can 
      eat it. what is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;an apple&quot; replied little Raymond &quot;no,&quot; 
      said the teacher &quot; it's a tomato but it shows your thinking.&quot; &quot;I've now 
      got something round, a greenish colored you can eat it.&quot; &quot;An apple,&quot; 
      replied little Ian &quot;No it's an onion, but it shows your thinking.&quot; Little 
      scruffy Johnny at the back of the class says &quot;I've got something under my 
      desk that's an inch long, white and it has a red end.&quot; &quot;Dirty little boy,&quot; 
      said the teacher &quot;No it's a match, but it shows you were thinking,&quot; he 
      answered.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&quot;Honey,&quot; said this husband to his wife, &quot;I invited a 
      friend home for supper.&quot; &quot;What? Are you crazy? The house is a mess, I 
      haven't been shopping, all the dishes are dirty, and I don't feel like 
      cooking a fancy meal!&quot; &quot;I know all that.&quot; &quot;Then why did you invite a 
      friend for supper?&quot; &quot;Because the poor fool's thinking about getting 
      married.&quot;</p>

      <p>A famous pilot was having dinner with a brunette and 
      when they finished they headed to a hotel. He calls room service and asked 
      for a bottle of red wine. When it arrived he put some red wine on the 
      brunettes lips and started kissing her. She asks what the red wine is for 
      and he replies, &quot;For when I have red meat - I have red wine.&quot; &quot;Oooohh&quot; she 
      says. A little while later the pilot jumps back onto the phone and orders 
      some white wine. It arrives moments later, he splashes it on her rack and 
      starts kissing her tits. She asks what the white wine is for and he 
      replies, &quot;For when I have white meat - I have white wine.&quot; Eventually he 
      works his way down to her cunt, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and a 
      match, sprinkles it on her muff and lights it on fire. &quot;Aaahhhhhhh, why 
      the fuck did you do that!?!&quot; she yells. The pilot replies, &quot;For when I go 
      down, I want to go down in flames.&quot;</p>

      Ya got me pregnant and so now I'm gonna kill myself.&quot; Bruce gets a lump in 
      his throat when he hears this. He says &quot;Strewth Sheila... Not only are you

      wait around here until someone does?&quot;</p>

            <p>Paul was ambling through a crowded street fair when 
      he decided to stop and sit at a Palm Reader's table. Said the mysterious 
      old woman, &quot;For fifteen dollars, I can read your love line and tell your 
      romantic future.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Paul readily agreed and the reader took one look at his open palm and 
      said, &quot;I can see that you have no girlfriend.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;That's true,&quot; said Paul.<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Oh my goodness, you are extremely lonely, aren't you?&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Yes,&quot; Paul shamefully admitted. &quot;That's amazing. Can you tell all of this 
      from my love line?&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Love line? No, from the calluses and blisters.&quot;</p>

      go deaf!&quot; To which the man replies, &quot;I've been shooting my love wads in 
      your mouth for the last 20 years and you're still fucking talking aren't 
      you?&quot;</p>
            <hr />

      He says, &quot;That's a nice name. Who named you, your mother?&quot;<br />
      She says, &quot;No, I named myself.&quot;<br />
      He says, &quot;Why Carmen?&quot;<br />
      She says, &quot;Because I like cars and I like men. What's your name?&quot;<br />
      He says, &quot;Beerfuck.&quot;</p>

            <p>Two guys were discussing popular family trends 
            on sex, marriage, and values. Stuart said, &quot;I didn't sleep with my 
            wife before we got married, did you?&quot; Leroy replied, &quot;I'm not sure, 
            what was her maiden name?</p>

            &quot;Dad, where did all of my intelligence come from?&quot; The father

            <p>An old man goes to the Wizard to ask him if he 
            can remove a curse he has been living with for the last 40 years. 
            The Wizard says, &quot;Maybe, but you will have to tell me the exact 
            words that were used to put the curse on you. The old man says 
            without hesitation, &quot;I now pronounce you man and wife.&quot;</p>

            <p>The science teacher stood in the front of the class 
      and said, &quot;Children, if you could have one raw material in the world, what 
      would it be?&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Little Stevie raised his hand and said &quot;I would want gold, because gold is 
      worth a lot of money and I could buy a Corvette.&quot; The teacher nodded, and 
      then she called on little Susie.<br />
      <br />
      Little Susie said, &quot;I would want platinum because platinum is worth more 
      than gold and I could buy a Porsche.&quot; The teacher smiled, and then she 
      called on Little Johnny.<br />
      <br />
      Little Johnny stood up and said, &quot;I would want silicone.&quot; The teacher 
      said, &quot;Silicone? Why silicone, Little Johnny?&quot; &quot;Because my mom has two 
      bags of the stuff and you should<br />
      see all the sports cars outside our house!&quot;</p>
