      <p>A vampire goes into a pub and asks for boiling 
      water. The barman says &quot;I thought you only drank blood?&quot; The vampire pulls 
      out a used tampon and says &quot;I'm making tea&quot;.</p>

      gynecologist due to a itchy rash in her puss... when she gets there the 
      doctor checked her out and asked &quot;when is the last time you've had sex?&quot; 
      the old lady tells the doctor that she is still a virgin.. he checks her 
      out again and the doctor tells the lady &quot;I don't really have a medical 
      term for this, so I will be blunt...Your cherry has rotted&quot;</p>

      <p>Three guys are discussing women. &quot;I like to watch a 
      woman's tits best, &quot; the first guy says.<br />
      The second says &quot;I like to look at a woman's ass.&quot; He asks the third guy 
      &quot;What about you?&quot;. &quot;Me? I prefer to see the top of her head.&quot;</p>

      <p>Bubba was fixing a door and he found that he needed 
      a new hinge, so he sent Mary Louise to the hardware store. At the hardware 
      store Mary Louise saw a beautiful teapot on a top shelf while she was 
      waiting for Joe Bob to finish waiting on a customer. When Joe Bob was 
      finished, Mary Louise asked how much for the teapot? Joe Bob replied 
      &quot;That's silver and it costs $100!&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;My goodness, that sure is a lotta money!&quot; Mary Louise exclaimed. She then 
      proceeded to describe the hinge that Bubba had sent her to buy, and Jo Bob 
      went to the backroom to find a hinge. From the backroom Joe Bob yelled 
      &quot;Mary Louise, you wanna screw for that hinge?' To which Mary Louise 
      replied, &quot;No, but I will for the teapot.&quot;</p>

      <p>Two old friends were just about to tee off at the 
      first hole of their local golf course when a chap carrying a golf bag 
      called out to them, &quot;Do you mind if I join you? My partner didn't turn 
      up.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Sure,&quot; they said, &quot;You're welcome.&quot; So they started playing and enjoyed 
      the game and the company of the newcomer. Part way around the course, one 
      of the friends asked the newcomer, &quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;I'm a hit man,&quot; was the reply. <br />
      <br />
      &quot;You're joking!&quot; was the response. <br />
      <br />
      &quot;No, I'm not,&quot; he said, reaching into his golf bag, and pulling out a 
      beautiful Martini sniper's rifle with a large telescopic sight. &quot;Here are 
      my tools.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;That's a beautiful telescopic sight,&quot; said the other friend, &quot;Can I take 
      a look? I think I might be able to see my house from here.&quot; So he picked 
      up the rifle and looked through the sight in the direction of his house. 
      &quot;Yeah, I can see my house all right. This sight is fantastic. I can see 
      right in the window. Wow, I can see my wife in the bedroom. Ha Ha, I can 
      see she's naked! What's that? Wait a minute, that's my neighbor in there 
      with her. He's naked as well! The bitch!&quot; He turned to the hit man, &quot;How 
      much do you charge for a hit?&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;I do a flat rate, for you, one thousand dollars every time I pull the 
      trigger.&quot; <br />
      <br />
      &quot;Can you do two for me now?&quot; <br />
      <br />
      &quot;Sure, what do you want?&quot; <br />
      <br />
      &quot;First, shoot my wife, she's always been mouthy, so shoot her in the 
      mouth. Then the neighbor, he's a mate of mine, a bit of a lad, so just 
      shoot his dick off to teach him a lesson.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      The hit man took the rifle and took aim, standing perfectly still for a 
      few minutes. &quot;Are you going to do it or not?&quot; said the friend impatiently. 
      &quot;Just wait a moment, be patient,&quot; said the hit man calmly, &quot;I think I can 
      save you a thousand dollars here.....&quot;</p>

      <p>There were these two gay guys that give each other 
      anal each night. One night before they give each other anal one of the 
      guys has to go to the toilet. So the other guy says &quot;okay but don't wank 
      in there, save it for later.&quot; and the first guy agrees. This guy was in 
      the toilet for a while so the other gay guy decides to check on him. Once 
      he opens the toilet door he sees lots of seamen everywhere. He gets angry 
      and yells &quot;I thought I told you not to wank and to save it for later!&quot; to 
      the first gay guy. The first gay guy replies &quot;I didn't wank, I just 
      farted.&quot;</p>

            <p>One day this man was driving for hours through the 
      country side and needed to go to the bathroom urgently. He sees an old 
      store off the side of the road, pulls up and proceeds to the bathroom. 
      When he was done dumping his captains log, he looked around and noticed to 
      his shock there was no toilet paper and a sign on the wall - &quot;Sorry, there 
      is no toilet paper, but if you wipe your arse with your index and middle 
      fingers and stick them in this hole they will be licked clean.&quot; The man 
      thought to himself that that was nasty and that he was not going to do 
      that. So he sits for a further hour trying to figure out what to do, and 
      eventually realizes that although its nasty, that he would do it. So he 
      wipes his arse with his fingers and sticks them in the hole. Then a man on 
      the other side slams two bricks onto the mans fingers so hard the 
      unbelievable pain causes him to shove his fingers in his mouth.</p>

            <p>One night, an 87-year-old woman came home from Bingo 
      to find her husband in bed with another woman... She became violent and 
      ended up pushing him off the balcony of their 20th-floor apartment, 
      killing him instantly. Brought before the court on the charge of murder, 
      she was asked if she had anything to say in defense of herself. &quot;Your 
      Honor,&quot; she began coolly, &quot;I figured that at 92, if he could screw, he 
      could fly.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman was shaking out a rug on the balcony 
            of her 17th floor condominium when a sudden gust of wind blew her 
            over the railing. &quot;Damn, that was stupid,&quot; she thought as she fell. 
            &quot;What a way to die.&quot; As she passed the 14th floor, a man standing at 
            his railing caught her in his arms. While she looked at him in 
            disbelieving gratitude, he asked, &quot;Do you suck?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; she shrieked, 
            aghast. So, he dropped her. As she passed the 12th floor, another 
            man reached out and caught her. &quot;Do you screw?&quot; he asked. &quot;Of course 
            not!&quot; she exclaimed before she could stop herself. He dropped her, 
            too. The poor woman prayed to God for one more chance. As luck would 
            have it, she was caught a third time, by a man on the eighth floor. 
            &quot;I suck! I screw!&quot; she screamed in panic. &quot;Slut!&quot; he said, and 
            dropped her.</p>

            <p>A middle aged couple went to a spouse swapping 
      party. They met a Martian couple and thought it would be nice to switch 
      partners for the night. So they went off with the opposite spouse. When 
      the woman saw the male martians' penis she said &quot;Well that's nice but it's 
      kind of short isn't it?&quot; Well the martian reached up and patted his head. 
      While he did that his penis got longer and longer. The woman saw that and 
      said &quot;That's nice but it's not very fat is it?&quot; The martian reached up and 
      pulled on his ears. As he was doing that his penis got fatter and fatter. 
      The women had a grand time that night. In the morning the man and woman 
      were comparing their experience. The woman said &quot;I really enjoyed myself, 
      we should swap again.&quot; The man said &quot;I enjoyed it too but, I just can't 
      figure out why she kept patting my head and pulling my ears!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>My husband came home with a tube of KY jelly and 
      said, &quot;This will make you happy tonight.&quot; He was right. When he went out 
      of the bedroom, I squirted it all over the doorknobs. He couldn't get back 
      in.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy phones up his Boss, but gets the bosses' wife 
      instead. &quot;I'm afraid he died last week.&quot; she explains. The next day the 
      man calls again and asks for the boss. &quot;I told you&quot; the wife replies, &quot;he 
      died last week.&quot; The next day he calls again and once more asks to speak 
      to his boss. By this time the wife is getting upset and shouts, &quot;I'VE 
      ALREADY TOLD YOU TWICE, MY HUSBAND, YOUR BOSS, DIED LAST WEEK! WHY DO YOU 
      KEEP CALLING?&quot; &quot;Coz,&quot; he replied laughing, &quot;I just love hearing it...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>&quot;Doc,&quot; says Steve, &quot;I want to be castrated.&quot;
            <br />
            &quot;What on earth for?&quot; asks the doctor in amazement. <br />
            <br />
            &quot;It's something I've been thinking about for a long time and I want 
            to have it done&quot; replies Steve. <br />
            <br />
            &quot;But have you thought it through properly?&quot; asks the doctor, &quot;It's a 
            very serious operation and once it's done, there's no going back. It 
            will change your life forever!&quot; <br />
            <br />
            &quot;I'm aware of that and you're not going to change my mind -- either 
            you book me in to be castrated or I'll simply go to another doctor.&quot;
            <br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well, OK.&quot;, says the doctor, &quot;But it's against my better judgment!&quot;
            <br />
            <br />
            So Steve has his operation, and the next day he is up and walking 
            very slowly, legs apart, down the hospital corridor with his drip 
            stand. Heading towards him is another patient, who is walking 
            exactly the same way. <br />
            <br />
            &quot;Hi there,&quot; says Steve, &quot;It looks as if you've just had the same 
            operation as me.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well,&quot; said the patient, &quot;I finally decided after 37 years of life 
            that I would like to be circumcised.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            Steve stared at him in horror and screamed, &quot;Shit! THAT'S the word!�</p>

            <p>These two starving bums are walking through an 
            alley when one of them sees a dead cat. He runs over, sits down and 
            starts to eat the cat, tearing the meat from its limbs. <br />
            He says to the other bum, &quot;Hey, I know you're hungry, too. Why don't 
            you eat some of this cat?&quot; &quot;Hell no!&quot; replies the second bum, &quot;That 
            cat's been dead for days, he's all stiff and cold and smelly!&quot; The 
            first bum says, &quot;Okay, suit yourself,&quot; and continues to eat 
            everything, skin, muscle, guts, all but the skeleton. A few hours 
            later as they are walking down the street the first bum says, &quot;Oh, I 
            don't feel so good. I think there might have been something wrong 
            with that cat.&quot; And just then, he pukes up a huge puddle of rotten 
            cat flesh and guts with stomach bile mixed in, all half digested and 
            looking like mush. The second bum sits down next to the puddle and 
            says, &quot;Now you're talking! It's been months since I had a WARM 
            meal!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy had a major argument with his 
            girlfriend. He was in the wrong, but not enough to back down without 
            an argument. So after storming away, and cooling off, the guy had a 
            think. He was clearly in the wrong and felt pretty guilty, with all 
            the trauma it had caused.<br />
            So to make it up to his girlfriend, he said he'd buy her a gift. 
            &quot;Any thing at all, my love&quot;, the guy said, overcome with remorse. 
            &quot;Oh, I don't know&quot;, she replied, &quot;You really shouldn't do this you 
            know. But, if you are, just get me something really expensive, that 
            I don't need.&quot; <br />
            The following day he booked her in for chemotherapy.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Three women were in the waiting room of a 
            gynaecologist, and each of them was knitting a sweater for their 
            baby-to-be. The first one stopped and took a pill. &quot;What was that?&quot; 
            The others asked her. &quot;Oh, it was Vitamin C - I want my baby to be 
            healthy.&quot; A few minutes later, another woman took a pill. &quot;What was 
            that?&quot; the others asked. &quot;Oh, it was iron - I want my baby to be big 
            and strong.&quot; They continued knitting. Finally the third woman took a 
            pill. &quot;What was that?&quot; the others asked her. &quot;It's Thalidomide,&quot; she 
            said, &quot;I just can't get the arms right on this fucking sweater!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A professor at the University of Texas was 
            giving a lecture on the supernatural. To get a feel for his 
            audience, he asks &quot;How many people here believe in ghosts?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            About 90 students raise their hands. &quot;Well, that's a good start. Out 
            of those of you <br />
            who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you've seen a ghost?&quot; 
            About 40 students raise their hands.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;That's really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously. Has 
            anyone here ever talked to a ghost?&quot; About 15 students raise their 
            hands.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?&quot; 3 students raise their 
            hands. &quot;That's fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further... 
            Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Way in the back, Bubba raises! his hand.<br />
            <br />
            The professor takes off his glasses, and says, &quot;Son, all the years 
            I've been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have made 
            love to a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your 
            experience.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The big redneck student replied with a nod and a grin, and began to 
            make his way up to the podium. When he reached the front of the 
            room, the professor asks, &quot;So, Bubba, <br />
            tell us what it's like to have sex with a ghost?&quot; Bubba replied, 
            &quot;Heck! From way back there I thought you said &quot;Goats!&quot;</p>
