            <p>Mum walked into the bathroom one day and found 
            young Johnny furiously scrubbing his dick with a toothbrush and 
            toothpaste. &quot;What the hell do you think you're doing, young man?!&quot; 
            she exclaimed. &quot;Don't try to stop me!&quot; Johnny warned. &quot;I'm gonna do 
            this three times a day, because there's no way I'm gonna get a 
            cavity that looks and smells as bad as my sister's.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>On returning from battle in the Falkland
            Islands, 3 soldiers are asked to report to their commander. The
            commander states that because of services rendered the army will pay
            each soldier a sum of �100 pound per inch on their bodies, from one
            point to another of their choice. The commander asks the first
            soldier, a special forces commando, how he can measure him up.
            &quot;I'll have the top of my head, to the tips of my toes, sahr!&quot;
            replies the man of war. &quot;Excellent,&quot; says the commander,
            that's &quot;70 inches, so here's �7000.&quot; Secondly a marine
            states that he will have the tip of one arm outstretched measured to
            the other outstretched. &quot;Excellent,&quot; replies the commander
            after measuring the marine, &quot;75 inches, so that's �7500.&quot;
            Thirdly he asks the explosives expert. &quot;I'll have measured the
            tip of my dick to he end of my balls sahr!&quot; The commander is a
            little taken aback by this but agrees, and after several seconds
            down in the private's privates he snaps back up saying &quot;Where
            in Christ are your balls soldier?!&quot; The soldier smiles at him
            and says &quot;Falkland Islands sahr!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two blokes were out walking home from work one 
            afternoon. &quot;Shit,&quot; said the first bloke, &quot;as soon as I get home, I'm 
            gonna rip the wife's knickers off!&quot; &quot;What's the rush?&quot; his mate 
            asked. &quot;The bloody elastic in the legs is killing me,&quot; the bloke 
            replied.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A farmer who's been involved in a terrible 
            road accident with a large truck ended up in court fighting for a 
            big compensation claim. &quot;I understand you're claiming damages for 
            the injuries you're supposed to have suffered?&quot; Stated the counsel 
            for the insurance company. &quot;Yes, that's right,&quot; replied the farmer, 
            nodding his head. &quot;You claim you were injured in the accident, yet I 
            have a signed police statement that says that when the attending 
            police officer asked you how you were feeling, you replied, 'I've 
            never felt better in my life.' Is that the case?&quot; &quot;Yeah, but�&quot; 
            stammered the farmer. &quot;A simple yes or not will suffice,&quot; counsel 
            interrupted quickly. &quot;Yes,&quot; Replied the farmer. Then it was the turn 
            of the farmer's counsel to ask him questions. &quot;Please tell the court 
            the exact circumstance of events following the accident when you 
            made your statement of health,&quot; his lawyer said. &quot;Certainly,&quot; 
            replied the farmer. &quot;After the accident my horse was thrashing 
            around with a broken leg and my poor old dog was howling in pain. 
            This cop comes along, takes one look at my horse and shoots him 
            dead. &quot;Then he goes over to my dog, looks at him and shoots him dead 
            too. Then he come straight over to me and asked me how I was 
            feeling. &quot;Now, mate, what the hell would you have said to him?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two old men suffering from long term memory 
            loss were sitting on the steps of the old-age home when an ice cream 
            van drove past. &quot;Gee,&quot; said the first old codger. &quot;I'd love an ice 
            cream right now.&quot; &quot;Would you like me to get you one?&quot; asked the 
            second old bloke. &quot;Are you joking?&quot; the first old fart snapped back. 
            &quot;You'd forget my order straight away.&quot; &quot;No I wouldn't,&quot; replied the 
            second.&quot; &quot;All right, then,&quot; said his mate. &quot;I want a double cone 
            with mint ice cream and choc chips, and a cherry on top.&quot; The second 
            old bloke repeated the order flawlessly. Five minutes later he 
            walked back carrying two meat pies. The first old bloke looked at 
            the pies in disgust then yelled, &quot;I knew I should've gone myself. You 
            forgot the bloody sauce!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Mat's dad picked him up from school to take 
            him to a dental appointment. Knowing the parts for the school play 
            were supposed to be posted today, he asked his son if he got a part. 
            Matt enthusiastically announced that he'd gotten a part. &quot;I play a 
            man who's been married for twenty years.&quot; &quot;That's great, son. Keep 
            up the good work and before you know it they'll be giving you a 
            speaking part.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This poor bloke went to hospital for a 
            circumcision but, because of some fuck up during the operation, he 
            ended up having a complete sex change. All the doctors and nurses 
            had gathered around his bed as he was waking up so they could give 
            him the bad news. Naturally, the poor bloke went to pieces and 
            started crying when they explained what had happened to him. &quot;Shit!&quot; 
            he moaned. &quot;this means I'll never be able to experience an erection 
            ever again!&quot; &quot;Of course you will,&quot; one of the doctors soothed. It'll 
            just have to be someone else's, that's all.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>&quot;Get this.&quot; said the bloke to his mates, &quot;Last 
            night while I was down the pub with you guys, a burglar broke into 
            my house. &quot;Did he get anything.&quot; his mates asked. &quot;yeah, a broken 
            jaw, six teeth knocked out, and a pair of broken nuts. The wife 
            thought it was me coming home drunk.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>It seems that there were twin brothers by the
            name of Jones, John and Joe. John was married and Joe was single.
            Joe was the proud owner of a dilapidated boat. It so happened that
            Joe's boat sank on the same day that John's wife died.</p>
            <p>A few days later a kindly old lady met Joe on the street, and
            mistaking him for John said:&quot; I was sorry to hear of
            your great loss, and you must feel terrible.&quot; Joe replied;
            &quot; Well, I am not a bit sorry. She was a rotten old thing
            from the start. Her bottom was all chewed up, and she smelled of old
            fish. The first time I got into her she made
            water faster that anything I ever saw. She had a crack and a pretty
            big hole in front that kept getting bigger and
            bigger every time that I used her. It got so I could handle her all
            right, but when someone else was using her she
            leaked like anything. This is what finished her off: Four guys from
            the other side of town came down looking for
            a good time. They asked if I could rent her to them. I warned them
            that she wasn't so hot, but the crazy fools all
            tried to get into her at the same time. It was too much for her and
            she cracked right up the middle! &quot; THE OLD LADY FAINTED.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Having determined that the husband was 
            infertile, a childless couple decided to try artificial 
            insemination. When the woman showed up at the clinic, she was told 
            to undress, get up on the table and place her feet in the stirrups. 
            She was feeling very uncomfortable about the whole situation and 
            when the doctor started dropping his pants, she freaked. &quot;Wait a 
            second! What the hell is going on here?&quot; she yelled. &quot;Don't you want 
            to get pregnant?&quot; asked the doctor. &quot;Well, yes, but�&quot; stammered the 
            woman. &quot;Well lie back and spread 'em,&quot; replied the doctor. &quot;Were out 
            of the bottled stuff, so you'll just have to settle for what's on 
            tap.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A truck driver pulled over to the side of the 
            road and picked up two homosexuals who were hitchhiking. They 
            climbed into the cab and the truck driver pulled the rig back onto 
            the highway. A few minutes later, the first fag said. &quot;Excuse me, 
            but I have to fart.&quot; He held his breath, then the truck driver heard 
            a low &quot;Hsssssss.&quot; A few miles down the road, the second fag 
            announced, &quot;Excuse me, but I have to fart.&quot; The announcement was 
            followed by another low &quot;Hsssssss.&quot; &quot;Jesus Fuckin Christ!&quot; the 
            truckie exclaimed. &quot;You fairies can't even fart like men. Listen to 
            this.&quot; A moment later he emitted a deafening staccato machine gun 
            burst from his arse. &quot;Ohhh!&quot; one fag exclaimed, turning to the 
            other. &quot;You know what we have here, Bruce? A real virgin!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A funeral service is being held for a woman 
            who has just passed away. At the end of the service the pall bearers 
            are carrying the casket out when they accidentally bump into a wall, 
            jarring the casket. They hear a faint moan. They open the casket and 
            find that the woman is actually alive. She lives for ten more years, 
            and then dies. A ceremony is again held at the same place, and at 
            the end of the ceremony the pall bearers are again carrying out the 
            casket. As they are walking, the husband cries out, &quot;watch out for 
            the fucking wall!'''</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A gay guy walked into a delicatessen and asked 
            the shopkeeper for a large knob of&nbsp; salami. &quot;Would you like it 
            sliced, sir?&quot; the shopkeeper asked politely. &quot;What do you think I 
            am?&quot; replied the fag, &quot;...a slot machine!?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man was having problems with premature 
            ejaculation so he decided to go to the doctor. He asked the doctor 
            what he could do to cure his problem. In response, the doctor said, 
            &quot;When you feel like you are getting ready to ejaculate, try 
            startling yourself.&quot; <br />
            <br />
            That same day the man went to the store and bought himself a starter 
            pistol. All excited to try this suggestion, he ran home to his wife. 
            At home, he found his wife was in bed, naked and waiting. As the two 
            began, they found themselves in the 69 position. The man, moments 
            later, felt the sudden urge to ejaculate and fired the starter 
            pistol. <br />
            <br />
            The next day, the man went back to the doctor. The doctor asked, 
            &quot;How did it go?&quot; <br />
            <br />
            The man answered, &quot;Not that well...when I fired the pistol, my wife 
            peed in my face, bit 3 inches off my penis and my neighbour came out 
            of the closet with his hands in the air!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man went to the doctor and said -
            &quot;Doctor, whenever I fart there's no smell&quot;. The doctor
            asked he man if he could do one there and then, which the man did,
            very loudly. The doctor sniffed a few times, said - &quot;Yes, I
            think I know what the problem is&quot;, went out of the surgery for
            a moment and came back with a very long stick with a hook on the
            end. The man became very frightened and asked - &quot;Doctor, what
            are you going to do with that thing?&quot;, to which the doctor
            replied - &quot;I'm going to open the window - you've got something
            wrong with your nose!&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and his wife were celebrating their 50th
            wedding anniversary. The wife says to her husband, &quot;For our
            anniversary this year, you can ask me one question, any question you
            want to. I will answer it truthfully.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The husband replies, &quot;Okay, this has been bothering me for a
            long time, but I haven't had the courage to ask before...but I have
            noticed that all of our eight children look similar to one another
            except one. I can't figure out how he got to look so different. Did
            he have a different father than the rest?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The wife stops. She is unable to look her husband in the eyes.
            Slowly she replies, &quot;yes. Yes he did have a different
            father.&quot; Her husband was taken aback. &quot;Oh! Okay...I must
            know. Please tell me. Who was that child's father?&quot; Again she
            cannot look her husband in the eyes. She is very distressed, and
            after a long silence she slowly said, &quot;YOU.&quot;</p>
