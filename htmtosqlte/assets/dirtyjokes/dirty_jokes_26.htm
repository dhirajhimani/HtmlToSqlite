            <p>A man takes his wife to the stock show. They
            start heading down the alley that had the bulls. They come up to the
            first bull and his sign stated: &quot;This bull mated 50 times last
            year.&quot; The wife turns to her husband and says, &quot;He mated
            50 times in a year, you could learn from him.&quot; They proceed to
            the next bull and his sign stated: &quot;This bull mated 65 times
            last year.&quot; The wife turns to her husband and says, &quot;This
            one mated 65 times last year. That is over 5 times a month. You can
            learn from this one, also.&quot; They proceeded to the last bull and
            his sign said: &quot;This bull mated 365 times last year.&quot; The
            wife's mouth drops open and says, &quot;WOW! He mated 365 times last
            year. That is ONCE A DAY!!! You could really learn from this
            one.&quot; The man turns to his wife and says, &quot;Go up and
            inquire if it was 365 times with the same cow.&quot;</p>

            <p>Ask any man what a woman's ultimate fantasy is
            and they will tell you, to have two men at once. According to a
            recent social logical study this is true, however most men do not
            realize that in this fantasy, one man is cooking, and the other is
            cleaning.</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">The couple has been married only
            two weeks. The husband, although very much in love, can't wait to go
            out on the town and party with his old buddies. &quot;Honey,&quot;
            says he to his new bride, &quot;I'll be right back...&quot;
            &quot;Where are you going, Coochy Coo?&quot; asks the wife.
            &quot;I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a
            beer.&quot; &quot;You want a beer, My Love?&quot; She opens the
            refrigerator door shows him 25 different brands of beer from 12
            different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, including six
            places he's never even heard of. The husband is nonplussed, and all
            he can think to say is, &quot;Yes, Honey Pie, but the bar you
            know...the frozen glass...&quot; He hasn't finished the sentence
            before wifey interrupts him by saying, &quot;You want a frozen
            glass, Puppy Face?&quot; She hands him a mug out of the freezer that
            is so cold that it burns his fingers &quot;Yes, Tootsie Roll,&quot;
            hubby says a bit desperately, &quot;but at the bar they have those
            hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long. I'll be
            right back. I promise. OK?&quot; &quot;You want hors d'oeuvres,
            Pookie Pooh?&quot; She opens the oven and removes 15 different hors
            d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, mushroom caps, pork
            strips, etc. &quot;But, Sweetie, Honey...at the bar...you know...the
            swearing, the dirty words and all that...&quot; &quot;You want dirty
            words, Cutie Pie? Here...DRINK YOUR FUCKING BEER IN YOUR FROZEN
            FUCKING MUG AND EAT YOUR FUCKING SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING
            ANYWHERE! GOT IT, ASSHOLE?!!&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Two aliens landed in the West
            Texas desert near an abandoned gas station. They approached one of
            the gas pumps, and one of the aliens addressed it, &quot;Greetings,
            Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.&quot; The gas
            pump, of course, didn't respond. The alien repeated the greeting.
            There was no response. The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be
            the gas pump's haughty attitude, drew his ray gun, and said
            impatiently, &quot;Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. How dare
            you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader, or I'll
            fire!&quot; The other alien shouted to his comrade &quot;No, you
            don't want to make him mad!&quot; But before he finished his
            warning, the first alien fired. There was a huge explosion that blew
            both of them 200 meters into the desert, where t hey landed in a
            heap. When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired
            turned to the other one and said, &quot;What a ferocious creature.
            It damn near killed us! How did you know it was so dangerous?&quot;
            The other alien answered, &quot;If there's one thing I've learned
            during my travels through the galaxy...any guy who can wrap his dick
            around himself twice and then stick it in his own ear, is someone
            you shouldn't mess with!&quot;</p>

            <p>Between the ages of 16 and 18, she is like
            Africa, virgin and unexplored. Between the ages of 19 and 35, she is
            like Asia, hot and exotic. Between the ages of 36 and 45, she is
            like America, fully explored, breathtakingly beautiful, and free
            with her resources. Between the ages of 46 and 56 she is like
            Europe, exhausted but still has points of interest. After 56, she is
            like Australia, everybody knows it's down there but who gives a
            damn.</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Maria had just got married and
            being a traditional Italian, she was still a virgin. So, on her
            wedding night, staying at her mother's house, she was nervous. But
            her mother reassured her. &quot;Don't worry, Maria. Tony's a good
            man. Go upstairs and he'll take care of you.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So up she went. When she got upstairs, Tony took off his shirt and
            exposed his hairy chest. Maria ran downstairs to her mother and
            says, &quot;Mama, Mama, Tony's got a big hairy chest.&quot;
            &quot;Don't worry, Maria,&quot; says the mother,&quot; all good men
            have hairy chests. Go upstairs. He'll take good care of you.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So, up she went again. When she got up in the bedroom, Tony took off
            his pants exposing his hairy legs. Again, Maria ran downstairs to
            her mother. &quot;Mama, Mama, Tony took off his pants and he's got
            hairy legs!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Don't worry. All good men have hairy legs. Tony's a good man.
            Go upstairs and he'll take good care of you.&quot; So up she went
            again. When she got up there, Tony took off his socks and on his
            left foot he was missing three toes. When Maria saw this, she ran
            downstairs. &quot;Mama, Mama, Tony's got a foot and a half!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Stay here and stir the pasta,&quot; says the mother.
            &quot;This is a job for Mama.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A group of prisoners are in their
            rehabilitation meeting. Their task for today is to each stand up in
            turn speak their name and admit to their fellow inmates what crime
            they committed. The first prisoner stands and says &quot;My name is
            Daniel and I'm in for murder&quot; Everyone gives him approving
            looks and pats on the back for admitting his wrongdoing. The next
            guy stands up and says &quot;My name is Mike and I'm in for armed
            robbery&quot; Again, there is a round of approving looks. This goes
            around the circle until it gets to the last guy. He stands up and
            says &quot;My name is Luke, but I'm not telling you what I'm in
            for&quot; The group leader says &quot;Now, come on Luke, you have to
            admit it to us to make any progress. Tell us what you did.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Ok then. I'm in for fucking dogs.&quot; Everyone is disgusted!
            They all shout &quot;What??!! How LOW can you get!&quot;
            &quot;Well...I did manage do to a dachshund one time, but I had to
            lift her back legs up a little&quot;, Luke replies.</p>

            <p align="left">Two couples had gone away for the
            weekend. The two guys, Jack and Bill, have decided to try to
            persuade their wives to do a bit of partner swapping for the night.
            After several drinks that night they succeed.<br />
            <br />
            Jack knows it's that time of the month for his wife and the thought
            of Bill not knowing this makes him smile. The guys agreed that when
            they sit around the breakfast table the following morning, they will
            tap their teaspoons on the side of their coffee mug the number of
            times that they did it with each other's wives.<br />
            <br />
            The next morning they are all at the breakfast table, slightly hung
            over and quite uncomfortable, when Jack proudly taps his teaspoon 3
            times against his coffee mug. After a brief moment of thinking, Bill
            takes his teaspoon and taps it once on the strawberry jam and 3
            times on the peanut butter!</p>

            <p align="left">A man is at the dentist's for a
            check-up. As the dentist leans over, he asks, &quot;Well... So you
            had oral sex this morning?&quot; &quot;How did you know?&quot; asks
            the man, embarrassed but also amazed at his dentist's perception.
            &quot;Was it the smell on my breath?&quot; &quot;No&quot; says the
            dentist. &quot;Well, did you see a pubic hair caught in my
            teeth?&quot; asks the man. &quot;No&quot; says the dentist.
            &quot;Well, what then? How did you know?&quot; asks the man, losing
            patience. The dentist says &quot;There's a little bit of shit on the
            end of your nose.&quot;</p>

            and at the wedding, one of his friends says to him, &quot;How the
            hell do the two of you have sex?&quot; The big guy says, &quot;I
            just sit there, naked, on a chair, she sits on top, and I bob her up
            and down.&quot; His friend says, &quot;You know, that don't sound
            too bad.&quot; The big guy says, &quot;Well, it's kind of like
            jerking off, only I got somebody to talk to.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Two gay men decide that they want
            to have a baby, but they don't want to adopt because they want the
            baby to be as close to their own as possible. So they both
            masturbate into a cup and have a doctor use their sperm to
            impregnate a female friend of theirs. Nine months later, the two
            fags are looking at their baby in the hospital nursery. All of the
            babies are crying and screaming except for theirs. &quot;Wow,&quot;
            one of the gay men says, &quot;Our baby is the most well behaved one
            in here.&quot; A nurse who happens to be walking by says, &quot;Now
            he's quiet, but wait till we take the pacifier out of his ass.&quot;</p>

            &quot;All right.&quot; They climb down under the boardwalk, and he
            bangs her. The next night, he runs into the same hooker, they go
            under the boardwalk, only this time while he's banging her, she
            blasts two incredible farts. When they get done, he hands her
            twenty-five dollars. She says, &quot;What's the extra five?&quot; He
            says, &quot;That's for blowing the sand off my balls.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A man was stranded in the desert
            for ten years. One day, a woman in a wetsuit walked up to this man
            and said, &quot;Would you like a cigar ?&quot; The man said,
            &quot;Lady, I ain't smoked in ten years.&quot; So, the woman
            unzipped the left arm of her wetsuit, and pulled out a cigar. Then,
            she said, &quot;Would you like a drink ?&quot; The man said,
            &quot;Lady, I ain't drank in ten years.&quot; So, she unzipped the
            right arm of her wetsuit, and pulled out a bottle of Jack Daniels.
            Last, she unzipped the front of her wetsuit and said, &quot;Would
            you like to play around ?&quot; The man said with astonishment...
            &quot;You mean to tell me that you got a golf set in there,
