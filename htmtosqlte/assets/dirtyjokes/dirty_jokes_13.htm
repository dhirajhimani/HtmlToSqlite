            <p>A mother and daughter loved to play around.
            They partied everyday and always ended up fucking everybody around.
            Their holes were played until they became seasoned and loose. One
            day, the daughter met the man of her dreams and decided to get
            married. Now, the man did not know about their flicks and thought
            the daughter was still a virgin. So he decided to leave any
            lovemaking until their wedding night. The daughter began to worry
            about the condition of her hole and consulted her mother, &quot;Mum,
            I'm worried, what will Peter do if he finds out about my
            hole?!!&quot; Mother said, &quot;Don't worry dear, I will teach you
            a way to fool your husband-to-be. Here's what you do, place an apple
            in your hole and it will be tight and he won't even notice it.&quot;
            So the daughter did what her mother taught her and everything went
            well and the stupid husband didn't even notice.</p>
            <p>This went on for a few months. Now, everytime
            the daughter wanted to bathe, she would take out the apple and place
            it on the wash basin and after bathing, she would put it back in her
            hole. One day, after bathing, she forgot to put it back and left it
            on the wash basin. The husband came into the washroom and saw the
            apple and thought that her wife left the apple for him and he ate
            it, &quot;Honey, thanks for the apple. It tasted great!&quot;
            Shocked, the daughter dare not tell her husband about it and went to
            consult her mother, &quot;Mum, I'm in deep shit now! I took out the
            apple while I was bathing and I forgot to put it back and Peter
            found the apple I left on the wash basin and ate it! What sould I
            do? Will he be poisoned? I'm scared, mum.&quot; Mother said,
            &quot;Don't worry dear, a few years ago, your father ate the
            WATERMELON I left in the washroom and he lived!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was an Amish girl that had just come of
            age to date. Her mother was helping her get ready to go out that
            night. As she was about ready she put on some gloves, because it was
            to be cold that night,and the Amish still ride in buggies. Her
            mother asked, &quot;why are you wearing gloves?&quot; She continued
            by saying that it wasn't lady like to wear gloves. The Girl said to
            her mother, &quot;its suppose to be cold tonight, what do I do with
            my hands if they get cold?&quot; Her mother replied. &quot;just
            stick your hands between your knees, and they will get warm.&quot;
            So the girl agreed. Her date picked her up and they went on there
            was. On their way home her hands got cold, so following her mother's
            orders, she stuck her hands between her knees. Her date looked over
            and said, &quot;what on earth do you have your hands between your
            legs for?&quot; She replied, &quot; my mother told me that if my
            hands got cold, to stick them between my legs to get them
            warm.&quot; Her date said to her, &quot; well my dick is frozen
            solid do you care if I stick it between your legs to get it
            warm?&quot; The girl said, &quot;well I don't see any harm in
            it.&quot; So he did. After returning home from her date she asked
            her mother,&quot; What do you know about them there dicks?&quot; Her
            mother said, &quot;Why what do you know about dicks?&quot; The girl
            looked at her mother and said, &quot;All I know is that when they
            thaw out they make an awful mess!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Once upon a time in a land far away, a
            beautiful, independent, self-assured princess happened upon a frog
            as she sat contemplating ecological issues on the shores of an
            unpolluted pond in a verdant meadow near her castle.<br />
            <br />
            The frog hopped into the princess' lap and said: Elegant Lady, I was
            once a handsome prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me.
            One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper
            young prince that I am, and then, my sweet, we can marry and set up
            housekeeping in your castle with my mother, where you can prepare my
            meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and feel forever grateful
            doing so.<br />
            <br />
            That night, as the princess dined sumptuously on a repast of lightly
            sautï¿½ed frogs legs seasoned in a wine and onion cream sauce she
            chuckled to herself and thought: I don't fucking think so.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This farmer has about 200 hens, but no rooster
            and he wants chicks. So, he goes down the road to the next farmer
            and asks if he has a rooster. The other farmer says, &quot;Yeah,
            I've got this great rooster, named Randy; he'll service every
            chicken you've got. No problem.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Well , Randy the rooster is a lot of money, but the farmer decides
            he'd be worth it. So , he buys Randy. The farmer takes Randy home
            and sets him down in the barnyard, giving the rooster a pep talk,
            &quot; Randy, I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of
            chickens to service here and you cost me a lot of money and I'll
            need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some
            fun,&quot; the farmer said with a chuckle.<br />
            <br />
            Randy seemed to understand, so the farmer points towards the hen
            house and Randy took off like a shot ~WHAM~ He nails every hen on
            there THREE or FOUR times and the farmer is just shocked. Randy runs
            out of the hen house and sees a flock of geese down by the lake
            ~WHAM~ He gets all the geese. Randy's up in the pigpen. He's in with
            the cows. Randy is jumping on every animal the farmer owns.<br />
            <br />
            The farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't
            even last the day. Sure enough, the farmer goes to bed and wakes up
            the next day to find Randy dead as a doorknob in the middle of the
            yard. Buzzards are circling overhead.<br />
            <br />
            The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful animal , shakes
            his head and says, &quot;Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself. I
            tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to
            yourself.&quot; Randy opens one eye, nods towards the sky and say's
            , &quot;Shhh. They're getting closer....&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The woman had been away for two days visiting
            a sick friend in another city. When she returned, her little boy
            greeted her by saying, &quot;Mommy, guess what! Yesterday I was
            playing in the closet in your bedroom and daddy came into the room
            with the lady next door and they got undressed and got into your bed
            and then daddy got on top of her...&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Sonny's mother held up her hand. &quot;Not another word. Wait till
            your father comes home and then I want you to tell him exactly what
            you've just told me.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The father came home. As he walked into the house, his wife said,
            &quot;I'm leaving you. I'm packing now and I'm leaving you.&quot;
            &quot;But why--&quot; asked the startled father. &quot;Go ahead,
            Sonny. Tell daddy just what you told me.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well,&quot; Sonny said, &quot;I was playing in your bedroom
            closet and daddy came upstairs with the lady next door and they got
            undressed and got into bed and daddy got on top of her and then they
            did just what you did with uncle John when daddy was away last
            summer.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A lecturer teaching medicine was tutoring a
            class on 'Observation'. He took out a jar of yellow-colored liquid.
            &quot;This&quot;, he explained, &quot;is urine. To be a doctor, you
            have to be observant to color, smell, sight, and taste.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            After saying this, he dipped his finger into the jar and put it into
            his mouth. His class watched on in amazement, most, in disgust. But
            being the good students that they were, the jar was passed, and one
            by one, they dipped one finger into the jar and then put it into
            their mouth.<br />
            <br />
            After the last student was done, the lecturer shook his head.
            &quot;If any of you had been observant, you would have noticed that
            I put my 2nd finger into the jar and my 3rd finger into my
            mouth.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two women had been having a friendly lunch
            when the subject turned to sex. &quot;You know, John and I have been
            having some sexual problems&quot;, Linda told her friend.
            &quot;That's amazing!&quot; Mary replied, &quot;So have Tom and I.
            We're thinking of going to a sex therapist&quot;, said Linda.
            &quot;Oh, we could never do that! We'd be too embarrassed!&quot;,
            responded Mary. &quot;But after you go, will you please tell me how
            it went?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Several weeks passed, and the two friends met for lunch again.
            &quot;So how did the sex therapy work out, Linda?&quot;, Mary asked.
            &quot;Things couldn't be better!&quot;, Linda exclaimed. &quot;We
            began with a physical exam, and afterward the doctor said he was
            certain he could help us. He told us to stop at the grocery store on
            the way home and buy a bunch of grapes and a dozen donuts. He told
            us to sit on the floor nude, and toss the grapes and donuts at each
            other. Every grape that went into my vagina, John had to get it out
            with his tongue. Every donut that I ringed his penis with, I had to
            eat. Our sex life is wonderful, in fact it's better than it's ever
            been!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            With that endorsement Mary talked her husband into an appointment
            with the same sex therapist. After the physical exams were completed
            the doctor called Mary and Tom into his office. &quot;I'm afraid
            there is nothing I can do for you,&quot; he said. &quot;But
            doctor,&quot; Mary complained, &quot;you did such good for Linda and
            John, surely you must have a suggestion for us! Please, please,
            can't you give us some help? Any help at all?&quot; &quot;Well,
            OK,&quot; the doctor answered. &quot;On your way home, I want you to
            stop at the grocery store and buy a sack of apples and a box of
            cheerios...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A Doctor recently had a patient
            &quot;drop&quot; in on him for an unscheduled appointment.
            &quot;What can I do for you today?&quot; the Doctor asked. The aged
            Gentleman replied: &quot;Doctor, you must help me. Every time I make
            love to my wife, my eyes get all bleary, my legs go weak, I can
            hardly catch my breath.... Doctor, I'm scarred!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The Doctor, looking at his 86 year old patient, said: &quot;Mr.
            Smith, these sensations tend to happen over time, especially to a
            man of your advanced years, but tell me, when did you first notice
            these symptoms?&quot; The old gent's response was: &quot;Well...
            three times last night, and twice again this morning!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Little Johnny and Susie were only 10 years
            old, but they just knew that they were in love. One day they decided
            that they wanted to get married, so Johnny went to Susie's father to
            ask him for her hand. Johnny bravely walked up to him and said
            &quot;Mr. Smith, me and Susie are in love and I want to ask you for
            her hand in marriage.&quot;</p>
            <p>Thinking that this was the cutest thing, Mr.
            Smith replied, &quot;Well Johnny, you are only 10. Where will you
            two live?&quot;&nbsp; Without even taking a moment to think about
            it, Johnny replied &quot;In Susie's room. It's bigger than mine and
            we can both fit there nicely.&quot;</p>
            <p>Still thinking this is just adorable, Mr.
            Smith said with a huge grin, &quot;Okay then how will you live?
            You're not old enough to get a job. You'll need to support
            Susie.&quot; Again, Johnny instantly replied, &quot;Our
            allowance...Susie makes 5 bucks a week and I make 10 bucks a week.
            That's about 60 bucks a month, and that'll do us just fine.&quot; By
            this time Mr. Smith was a little shocked that Johnny had put so much
            thought into this. So, he thought for a moment trying to come up
            with something that Johnny wouldn't have an answer for. After a
            second, Mr. Smith said, &quot;Well Johnny, it seems like you have
            got everything all figured out. I just have one more question for
            you. What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of
            your own?&quot;</p>
            <p>Johnny just shrugged his shoulders and said,
            &quot;Well, we've been lucky so far....&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man is telling a story... &quot;I was
            playing golf, and even though I am usually a pretty good player, I
            was playing horribly that day.&nbsp; As I was about to tee off at
            the fourth hole I heard a voice say, &quot;three wood.&quot; I
            looked around and no one was behind me so I took my stance.&nbsp;
            Then once again I heard &quot;three wood.&quot;&nbsp; I looked down
            and there was a frog at the corner of the tee box, and he was
            telling me to use my three wood. I thought it was stupid but I was
            playing so badly that I thought nothing could hurt me so I took out
            my three wood. It was a long par four, and I hit the ball straight
            250 yards with that three wood.&nbsp; Since the frog seemed to be
            lucky I picked him up and took him along with me.&nbsp; At the next
            whole he told me to use my five iron.&nbsp; It was a par three and I
            got my first hole in one ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a least a birdie
            on all the rest of the holes, and all I had to do was listen to that
            frog.</p>
            <p>That night I took the frog to the casino in my
            hotel.&nbsp; We played Roulette.&nbsp; I put my money where the frog
            said and won on every spin of the wheel. After that I was tired so I
            went up to bed.&nbsp; I took the frog out of my pocket and put it on
            the dresser.&nbsp; Suddenly it looked at me and said, &quot;kiss
            me.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I wasn't about to kiss a frog, but he said
            it again. So I kissed the frog and he turned into the most beautiful
            fourteen year old girl you have ever seen in your entire life. And
            that your honor is how that fourteen year old girl ended up in my
            hotel room.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This guy goes into a whorehouse and tells the
            mistress he wants to eat out a girl for the first time. She sends
            him up and he meets this deadly blonde chick. She whips down her
            pants and he starts licking her twat. Minutes later he feels
            something in his mouth and spits out a corn niblet. Thinking this is
            normal, as he has never done it before continues eating her out.
            Minutes pass and he finds a piece of carrot in his mouth. Still
            thinking this is normal he continues. Soon after he finds a piece of
            meat and stands up. &quot;Excuse me miss, but are you sick?&quot;
            She looks at him and replies &quot;No, but the last guy was!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The manager hired a new secretary. she was
            young, sweet, and polite. One day while taking dictation, she
            noticed his fly was open. While leaving the room, she courteously
            said, &quot;Oh sir, did you know that your barracks door was
            open.&quot; He did not understand her remark, but later on happened
            to look down and saw that his zipper was open. He decided to have
            some fun with his new employee.</p>
            <p>Calling her in, he asked, &quot;By the way,
            Miss Jones, when you saw my barracks door open this morning, did you
            also see a soldier standing at attention.&quot; The secretary, who
            was quite witty, replied, &quot;Why, no sir, all I saw was a little
            disabled veteran, sitting on two duffel bags!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>An old lady is rocking away the last of her
            days on her front porch, reflecting on her long life, when, all of a
            sudden, a fairy godmother appears in front of her and informs her
            that she will be granted three wishes.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well, now,&quot; says the old lady, &quot;I guess I would like
            to be really, really rich.&quot; ***POOF*** her rocking chair turns
            to solid gold. She smiles and says, &quot;Gee, I guess I wouldn't
            mind being a young, beautiful princess.&quot; ***POOF*** she turns
            into a beautiful young woman.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Your third wish?&quot; asked the fairy godmother. Just then
            the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front of them.
            &quot;Ooh...can you change him into a handsome prince?&quot; she
            asks. ***POOF*** there before her stands a young man more handsome
            than anyone could possibly imagine.<br />
            <br />
            She stares at him, smitten. With a smile that makes her knees weak.
            He saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear: &quot;Bet
            you're sorry you had me neutered!&quot;</p>
