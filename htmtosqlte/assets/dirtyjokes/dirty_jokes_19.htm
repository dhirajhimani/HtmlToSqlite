            <p>A mother walks into her daughters room holding
            a condom in her hand, &quot;I found this while cleaning your room
            today.... Are you sexually active?&quot; To which the daughter
            replies, &quot;No, I just lay there.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young guy drops off his girlfriend at her
            home after being out together on a date. When they reach the front
            door he leans up against the house with one hand and says to her,
            &quot;How about a blowjob?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;What! Are you crazy!&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Don't worry, it will be quick,&quot; he ensures his
            girlfriend.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;No! Someone might see us...&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;It's just a small blowjob,&quot; he insists, &quot;and I know
            you like it.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;No! I said no!&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Baby... don't be like that.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Suddenly, the girl's younger sister shows up at the door in her
            nightgown, with her hair a mess, and rubbing her eyes. She looks at
            them and smirks, &quot;Dad says either you blow him, I blow him, or
            he'll come downstairs and blow the guy himself... but for God's sake
            tell your boyfriend to take his hand off the intercom.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Two weeks ago was my 44th
            birthday and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning. I went down to
            breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say &quot;Happy
            Birthday&quot; and probably have a present for me. She didn't even
            say &quot;Good Morning&quot;, let alone any &quot;Happy
            Birthday.&quot; I thought, &quot;Well, that's wives for you. The
            children will remember. &quot;The children came down to breakfast
            and didn't say a word.</p>
            <p align="left">When I started to the office I
            was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office,
            my secretary, Janet said, &quot;Good Morning, Boss, Happy
            Birthday.&quot; I felt a little better. Someone had remembered.
            I worked until noon, then Janet knocked on my
            door and said, &quot;You know it is such a beautiful day outside and
            it is your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me.&quot; I
            said, &quot;By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day.
            Let's go.</p>
            <p align="left">We went to lunch. We didn't go
            where we normally go. We went out into the country to a little
            private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.
            On the way back to the office, she said, &quot;You know, it is such
            a beautiful day, we don't need to go back to the office, do
            we?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I guess not.&quot; She said, &quot;Let's
            go to my apartment.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">After arriving at her apartment
            she said, &quot;Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the
            bedroom and slip into something more comfortable. Sure,&quot; I
            excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six
            minutes she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my
            wife, children and dozens of our friends. They were all singing
            Happy Birthday.......and there I sat on the couch.......naked.</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">After hearing a couple's
            complaints that their intimate life wasn't what it used to be, the
            sex counsellor suggested they vary their position. &quot;For
            example,&quot; he suggested, &quot;you might try the wheelbarrow.
            Lift her legs from behind and off you go.&quot; The eager husband
            was all for trying this new idea as soon as they got home.
            &quot;Well, okay,&quot; the hesitant wife agreed, &quot;but on two
            conditions. First, if it hurts you have to stop right away, and
            second...&quot; she&nbsp;<br />
            continued, &quot;you have to promise we won't go past my parents'
            house.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">An old man woke up in the middle
            of the night and found, to his utter astonishment, that his pecker
            was as hard as a rock for the first time in two years. He shook his
            wife by the shoulder until she woke up and showed her his enormous
            boner. &quot;Check this out!&quot; he happily exclaimed. &quot;What
            do you think we should do with it?&quot; With one eye open, his wife
            replied, &quot;Well, now that you've got all the wrinkles out, now
            would be a good time to wash it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A businessman and his secretary,
            overcome by passion, go to his house for an early afternoon quickie.
            &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he assures her, &quot;my wife is out of
            town on a business trip, so there's no risk.&quot; As one thing
            leads to another, the woman reaches into her purse and suddenly
            gasps, &quot;We have to stop! I forgot to bring birth control!&quot;
            &quot;No problem,&quot; he replies, &quot;I'll get my wife's
            diaphragm.&quot; After a few minutes of searching, he returns to the
            bedroom in a fury. &quot;That witch!&quot; he exclaims. &quot;She
            took it with her! I always knew she didn't trust me!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">I once was on a plane where I was
            served by an obviously homosexual male flight attendant. At one
            point, he bounced over to where I was sitting and announced
            &quot;The Captain has asked me to announce that he will be landing
            the big scary plane shortly, so if you could just put up your trays,
            that would be great.&quot; I did as he had instructed but the woman
            sitting next to me did not.<br />
            <br />
            A few moments later, our flight attendant came back and said to her:
            &quot;Ma'am, perhaps you couldn't hear me over the big scary engine,
            but I asked you to please put up your tray so that the captain can
            land the plane.&quot; She still wouldn't comply. Now he was getting
            angry and asked her again to put up the tray.<br />
            <br />
            She then calmly turned to him and said: &quot;In my country, I am
            called a princess. I take orders from no one.&quot; The flight
            attendant replied, &quot;Oh yeah? Well in MY country, I'm called a
            queen and I outrank you, bitch, so put the tray up!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">When her husband passed away, the
            wife put the usual death notice in the newspaper, but added that he
            had died of gonorrhoea. Once the daily newspapers had been
            delivered, a good friend of the family phoned and complained
            bitterly, &quot;You know very well that he died of diarrhoea, not
            gonorrhoea.&quot; Replied the widow, &quot;Yes, I know that he died
            of diarrhoea, but I thought it would be better for posterity to
            remember him as a great lover rather than the big shit that he
            really was.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Your honour, I am 75 years old.
            So here I am, sitting there on my porch on a warm spring evening,
            when a young man comes creeping up on the porch and sits beside me.
            He starts to rub my thigh, and it feels good, Your Honour. So I
            don't stop him, and he begins to rub my old breasts, Your Honour.
            Why, Your Honour, I haven't felt that good in years! So I just
            spread my old legs and say to him, &quot;Take me, young man, Take
            me!&quot; That's when he yelled, &quot;April Fool&quot; and that's
            when I shot the Fucking Son of a Bitch!!</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A man with a stuttering problem
            tries everything he can to stop stuttering, but he can't. Finally,
            he goes to a world&nbsp; renowned doctor for help. The doctor
            examines him and says &quot;I've found your problem. Your penis is
            twelve inches long. It weighs so much that it's pulling on your
            lungs, causing you to stutter.&quot; So he asks, &quot;What's he
            cure, doc?&quot; The doctor replies, &quot;Well, we have to cut off
            six inches.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The man is eager to cure his stuttering so he agrees to the
            operation. The operation is a success, and he stops stuttering. Two
            months later, the man calls the doctor and tells him that since he's
            had the 6 inches cut off, all of his girlfriends have dumped him,
            and his love life has gone down the tubes. He insists that the
            doctor do another operation to add the six inches back on.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            There is silence on the other end of the telephone, so the man
            repeats, &quot;Hey doc, didn't you hear me? I want my&nbsp;six
            inches back!&quot; Finally, the doctor responds,
            &quot;F-f-f-f-f-f-u-c-k y-y-y-y-ou!&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A woman came home just in time to
            find her husband in bed with another woman. With superhuman strength
            borne of fury, she dragged her husband down the stairs to the garage
            and put his penis in a vise. She then secured it tightly and removed
            the handle. Next she picked up a hacksaw. The husband terrified,
            screamed, &quot;Stop! Stop! You're not going to......to....cut it
            off are you?!&quot; The wife, with a gleam of revenge in her eye,
            said,&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nope.&nbsp; You are. I'm going to set the
            garage on fire.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">An elderly couple came back from
            a wedding one afternoon and were in a pretty romantic mood. While
            sitting on their loveseat, the elderly woman looked at her companion
            and said, &quot;I remember when you used to kiss me every chance you
            had.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The old man feeling a bit obliged leaned over and gave her a peck on
            the cheek. Then she said, &quot;I also remember when you used to
            hold my hand at every opportunity.&quot; The old man again feeling
            obligated reached over and gently placed his hand on hers. The
            elderly woman then stated, &quot;I also remember when you used to
            nibble on my neck and send chills down my spine.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            This time, the old man had a blank stare on his face and started to
            get up off the couch. As he began to walk out of the living room,
            his wife asked, &quot;Was it something I said, where are you
            going?&quot; The old man looked at her and replied, &quot;I'm going
            in the other room to get my teeth!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A mother was walking down the
            hall when she heard a humming sound coming from her daughter's
            bedroom When she opened the door she found her daughter naked on the
            bed with a vibrator. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; She exclaimed.
            The daughter replied, &quot;I'm 35 and still living at home with my
            parents and this is the closest I'll ever get to a husband.&quot;
            Later that week, the father was in the kitchen and heard a humming
            sound coming from the basement. When he went downstairs, he found
            his daughter naked on a sofa with her vibrator. &quot;What are you
            doing?&quot; He exclaimed. The daughter replied, &quot;I'm 35 and
            still living at home with my parents and this is the closest I'll
            ever get to a husband.&quot; A couple of days later the mother heard
            the humming sound again, this time coming from the den. Upon
            entering the room, she found her husband watching television with
            the vibrator buzzing away beside him. &quot;What are you
            doing?&quot; She asked. He replied, &quot;Watching the game with my
            son-in-law.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A man went to the police station
            wishing to speak with the burglar who had broken into his house the
            night before. &quot;You'll get your chance in court,&quot; said the
            desk sergeant. &quot;No, no, no!&quot; insisted the man. &quot;I
            want to know how he got into the house without waking my wife. I've
            been trying to do that for years!&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A lady went to her doctor for a
            check-up. when asked how she got the bruises on the outside of her
            thighs, she explained that she got them from having sex.&nbsp;The
            doctor then told her she would have to change positions until the
            bruises healed.&nbsp;She replied &quot;Oh doctor, I can't... my
            dog's breath is awful!&quot;&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="left">One day God and Adam were walking
            the garden. God told Adam that it was time to populate the Earth.
            &quot;Adam, you can start by kissing Eve.&quot; Adam looks puzzled
            at God, &quot;Lord, what is a kiss?&quot;. God explained, and then
            Adam took Eve behind the bush and kissed her. A little while later,
            Adam returned with a big smile and said, &quot;Lord! That was great!
            What's next?&quot; &quot;Adam, I now want you to caress Eve.&quot;
            Puzzled again he asks, &quot;Lord, what is caress?&quot; God
            explained, and then Adam took Eve behind the bush and caressed her.
            A little while later, Adam returned with a big smile and said,
            &quot;Lord that was even better than a kiss! What's next?&quot;
            &quot;Here is what gets the deed done. I now want you to make love
            to Eve.&quot; Puzzled yet again, &quot;Lord, what is make
            love?&quot; asked Adam. God explained, and then Adam took Eve behind
            the bush. A few seconds later, Adam returned and asked, &quot;Lord,
            what is a headache?&quot;</p>
