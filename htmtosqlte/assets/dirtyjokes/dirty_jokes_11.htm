            <p>Three guys enter a disabled swimming contest.
            The first has no arms. The second no legs and the third has no body,
            just a head. They all line up, the whistle blows and
            &quot;splash&quot; they're all in the pool<br />
            <br />
            The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the guy with no
            legs is closing fast. The head of course sank straight to the
            bottom.<br />
            <br />
            Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first. He can
            still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool,so he decides
            he had better dive down to rescue him.<br />
            <br />
            He picks up the head, swims back up to the surface and places the
            head at the side of the pool, where-upon the head starts coughing
            and spluttering.<br />
            <br />
            Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts: &quot;Three years
            I've spent learning to swim with my fucking ears, then two minutes
            before the whistle, some asshole puts a swimming cap on me!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A crowded United Air Lines flight was
            cancelled. A single agent was assigned to rebook a long line of
            unhappy inconvenienced travelers. She was doing her best when
            suddenly an angry customer pushed his way to her desk. He slapped
            his ticket down on the counter and shouted: &quot;I don't want to
            stand in line. I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST
            CLASS and RIGHT NOW!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The young agent replied, &quot;I'm sorry, sir, I'll try to help you
            but I've got to help these folks first. I'm sure we'll be able to
            work things out for you.&quot; The angry passenger was unimpressed
            and unrelenting. He asked loudly, so that all the passengers could
            hear, &quot;I don't want to stand in line! Do you have any idea who
            I am?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Without hesitation, the agent smiled and grabbed her public address
            microphone. &quot;May I have you attention, please,&quot; her voice
            bellowed through the terminal. We have a passenger here WHO DOES NOT
            KNOW WHO HE IS. If anyone can help him identify himself, please come
            to the gate.&quot; With the crowd laughing hysterically, he glared
            at her and swore &quot;Fuck you!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Without flinching, she smiled an said, &quot;I'm sorry, sir, but
            you'll have to stand in line for that too!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man goes to the doctor after feeling ill.
            The doctor says, &quot;You know, you should have come to see me
            sooner. Unfortunately you have waited too long and you are going to
            die this evening.&quot; The man is distraught and wonders how he is
            going to tell his wife. Well, he tells her and she takes it pretty
            well. &quot;Honey, this is going to be a night that you will always
            remember,&quot; she says. &quot;I am going to treat you like a
            king.&quot; She prepares a scrumptious gourmet dinner with wine,
            candles-the works.</p>
            <p>After dinner she slips away and returns in the
            most incredible negligee the man has ever seen. She leads him into
            their bedroom. They make the most passionate love they have ever
            made. The man is beside himself. Once done, the wife rolls over to
            go to sleep knowing she kept her promise. Well, the husband is wide
            awake watching the clock.</p>
            <p>He knows that he is doomed. He taps
            her...&quot;Honey?&quot; he whispers. She rolls over and again
            proceed to make love. Again when they were done she rolls over and
            he taps her. She is getting cranky, but under the circumstances she
            grants her husband's dying wishes. Finally the wife rolls over and
            begins to snore. Well, the man decides to tap her again.
            &quot;Honey?&quot; he whispers. She rolls over and yells, &quot;Oh
            sure! You don't have to get up in the morning!!!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A wife arrived home after a long shopping
            trip, and was horrified to find her husband in bed with a young,
            lovely thing. Just as she was about to storm out of the house, her
            husband stopped her with these words: &quot;Before you leave, I want
            you to hear how this all came about. Driving home, I saw this young
            girl, looking poor and tired, I offered her a ride. She was hungry,
            so I brought her home and fed her some of the roast you had
            forgotten about in the refrigerator. Her shoes were worn out so I
            gave her a pair of your shoes you didn't wear because they were out
            of style. She was cold so I gave her that new birthday sweater you
            never wore even once because the color didn't suit you. Her slacks
            were worn out so I gave her a pair of yours that you don't fit into
            anymore. Then as she was about to leave the house, she paused and
            asked, 'Is there anything else that your wife doesn't use anymore?'
            &quot;And so, here we are!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Husband and wife are getting all snugly in
            bed. The passion is heating up. But then the wife stops and says
            &quot;I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.&quot; The
            husband says &quot;WHAT??&quot; The wife explains that he must not
            be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. The husband realizes
            that nothing is going to happen tonight and he might as well deal
            with it. So the next day the husband takes her shopping at a big
            dept. store. He walks around and has her try on three very expensive
            outfits. And then tells his wife. We'll take all three of them. Then
            goes over and gets matching shoes worth $200 each. And then goes to
            the Jewelry Dept. and gets a set of diamond earrings. The wife is so
            excited (she thinks her husband has flipped out, but she does not
            care). She goes for the tennis bracelet. The husband says &quot;but
            you don't even play tennis, but OK if you like it then lets get
            it.&quot; The wife is jumping up and down so excited she cannot even
            believe what is going on. She says &quot;I am ready to go, lets go
            to the cash register.&quot; The husband says,&quot; no - no - no,
            honey we're not going to buy all this stuff.&quot; The wife's face
            goes blank. &quot;No honey - I just want you to HOLD this stuff for
            a while.&quot; Her face gets really red and she is about to explode
            and then the Husband says, &quot;You must not be in tune with my
            financial needs as a Man!!!</p>

            <p>Three ladies were on a flight when suddenly
            the captain announced &quot; Please prepare for a crash landing
            &quot;. The first lady put on all her jewelry . Surprised by this
            the other ladies questioned her actions. The first lady replied,
            well when they come to rescue us they will see that I am rich and
            will rescue me first. The second lady not wanting to be left behind,
            began to take off her top and bra. Why are you doing that the other
            ladies questioned, well when they come to rescue us they will see my
            great tits and will take me first.<br />
            <br />
            The third lady who was African not wanting to be out done took off
            her pants and panties.<br />
            Why are you doing that the other ladies questioned, well they always
            search for the black box first ?</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman goes into a restaurant in a small town
            out in the country. She orders the chicken and starts to eat. Eating
            too fast she starts to choke on a chicken bone. Well these two
            country boys in the next booth notice she is choking so they get up
            and go over to help her. The first country boy drops his coveralls
            and bends over and the second country boy starts licking his butt.
            The women watches these two go at it and is grossed out. She pukes
            all over the place, dislodging the chicken bone from her throat. The
            country boy pulls his overalls back up and says to the other,
            &quot;You're right Leroy, that hind-lick maneuver works like a
            charm.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Our dog left so many disgusting stains on our
            carpet that we had to buy new carpet. I didn't want to be stupid
            about the new purchase, so I cut the stains out of the old carpet.
            When the carpet guy asked what color we wanted, I pulled out the
            stained patches and said, &quot;Yeah, can you match this
            color!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and his four year old son are talking,
            when his son asks him &quot;Dad, what does a pussy look like?&quot;
            The Dad confused, asks him &quot; before or after sex?&quot; The kid
            says &quot;Ummm before sex&quot; So the dad says to him &quot;Well
            have u ever seen a beautiful red rose with soft red peddles.&quot;
            &quot;yeah&quot; says the son.&quot;well what about after sex&quot;
            he says to his dad. His dad replies &quot; Have you ever seen a
            bulldog eating mayonnaise&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy meets a girl out at a nightclub and she
            invites him back to her place for the night, her parents are out of
            town and this is the perfect opportunity. They get back to her house
            and they go into her bedroom, and when the guy walks in the door he
            notices all these fluffy toys. There's hundreds of them, fluffy toys
            on top of the wardrobe, fluffy toys on the bookshelf and window
            sill, there's more on the floor, and of course fluffy toys all over
            the bed. Later, after they've had sex, he turns to her and asks,<br />
            <br />
            ''So, how was I?''<br />
            <br />
            She says, ''Well, you can take anything from the bottom shelf.''</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A huge muscular man walks into a bar and
            orders a beer. The bartender can't help but stare at the guy because
            in contrast to his large muscles, the man has a head that is the
            size of an orange. The bartender hands the guy his beer and says,
            ''You know, I'm not gay but I want to compliment you on your
            physique, it really is phenomenal! But I have a question, why is
            your head so small?''<br />
            <br />
            The big guy nods slowly. He's obviously fielded this question many
            times. ''One day,'' he begins, ''I was hunting and got lost in the
            woods. I heard someone crying for help. I followed the cries and
            they led me to a frog that was sitting next to a stream.''<br />
            <br />
            ''No shit?'' says the bartender, thoroughly intrigued.<br />
            <br />
            ''Yeah, so I picked up the frog and it said, Kiss me. Kiss me and I
            will turn into a genie and grant you three wishes.'''<br />
            <br />
            ''Keep going!''<br />
            <br />
            I looked around to make sure I was alone and gave the frog a kiss.
            POOF! The frog turned into a beautiful, voluptuous, naked woman.<br />
            <br />
            She said, ''You now have three wishes.''<br />
            <br />
            I looked down at my scrawny 115 pound body and said, ''I want a body
            like Arnold Schwarzenneger.'' She nodded, snapped her fingers, and
            POOF there I was, so huge that I ripped out of my clothes and was
            standing there naked!<br />
            <br />
            She then asked, ''What will be your second wish?''<br />
            <br />
            ''What next?'' begged the bartender.<br />
            <br />
            I looked hungrily at her beautiful body and replied, ''I want to
            make sensuous love with you here by this stream.'' She nodded, laid
            down, and beckoned to me. We made love right there by that stream
            for hours!<br />
            <br />
            Afterwards, as we lay there next to each other, sweating from our
            glorious lovemaking, she whispered into my ear, ''You know, you do
            have one more wish. What will it be?''<br />
            <br />
            I looked at her and replied, ''How 'bout a little head?''</p>
            <hr />
            <p>One day a pregnant wife announced that she was
            going to start looking for names for her and her husbands unborn
            child. When the father had gotten home from work the mother held up
            a baby book and said that the name was going to be Ophella. The
            husband (who was quite witty) didn't like the name he said,
            &quot;That's a good name, it reminds me of this girl I dated in high
            school.&quot; The next day the mother had changed the name to Sarah.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Once there was a little boy who was curious
            about what a strip club was like so one day he decided to sneak into
            one. Once he was in, he watched as the strippers danced. He watched
            until they started taking of their clothing. That's when he bolted
            out the door and started running down the street and into a man. The
            man asks the boy, &quot;What's wrong young man? You look like you
            just saw a ghost!&quot;. The little boy replies, &quot;My mommy and
            daddy told me that if I ever watched anybody undress, I'd turn to
            stone...and all of a sudden I felt something hard!&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A married man keeps telling his wife
            &quot;Honey, you have such a beautiful butt&quot;. Every person in
            the town agrees that she does have a very beautiful butt. The man's
            birthday is coming up so she decides to take a trip to the tattoo
            parlor and get the words &quot;Beautiful butt&quot; tattooed on her
            ass.<br />
            <br />
            She walks in and tells the tattoo artist he husband thinks she has a
            beautiful butt. He looks and says, &quot;You do have a beautiful
            butt&quot;. She then tells the man she wants Beautiful butt tattooed
            on her ass. The man tells her &quot;I can't fit that on your ass, it
            takes up too much space. But I tell you what, I will tattoo the
            letters BB on each cheek and that can stand for beautiful butt. She
            agrees and gets it done.<br />
            <br />
            On the man's birthday she hears him come home and is only wearing a
            robe. She then stands at the top of the stairs. He opens the door
            and she says &quot;look honey.&quot; She then takes off the robe she
            is wearing, bends over, and the man yells &quot;WHO THE FUCK IS
            BOB?&quot;!</p>
