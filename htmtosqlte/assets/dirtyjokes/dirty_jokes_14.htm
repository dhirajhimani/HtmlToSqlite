            <p>An office manager arrives at his department
            and sees an employee sitting behind his desk totally stressed out.
            He gives him the advice: &quot;I went home every afternoon for two
            weeks and had myself pampered by my wife. It was fantastic and it
            really helped, you should try it too!&quot;. Two weeks later when
            the manager arrives at his department he sees the man happy and full
            of energy at his desk. The faxes are piling up and the computer is
            running at full speed. &quot;I see you followed my advice?&quot;.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I did&quot;, answers the employee, &quot;It was great! By the
            way I didn't know you had such a nice house!&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A 92 year-old man went to the doctor to get a
            physical. A few days later the doctor saw the man walking down the
            street with a gorgeous young lady on his arm. At his follow up visit
            the doctor talked to the man and said, &quot;You're really doing
            great, aren't you?&quot; The man replied, &quot;Just doing what you
            said Doctor, 'Get a hot mamma and be cheerful'.&quot; The Doctor
            said, &quot;I didn't say that. I said you got a heart murmur. Be
            careful.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy is walking down the street with some
            chicken wire under his arm. His neighbor sees him and asks what he
            has. The guy replies, &quot;Its chicken wire and I'm going to catch
            some chickens.&quot; His neighbor says, &quot;You fool, you can't
            catch chickens with chicken wire.&quot; Later that night, he sees
            the guy walking down the street dragging 12 chickens. The next day
            he sees him walking down the street with some duct tape under his
            arm. Once again he asks what the guy is up to. The guy says he has
            some duct tape and he is going to catch some ducks. He replies,
            &quot;You fool, you can't catch ducks with duct tape.&quot; Sure
            enough later that night, he sees the guy walking down the street
            dragging 12 ducks behind him. The next day, he sees the guy walking
            with something else under his arm. He asks what it is. The guy
            replies, &quot;Its pussy willow.&quot; He says, &quot;Hold on, let
            me get my hat.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Four men got together at a reunion. Three of
            them had sons and they started bragging about them, while the fourth
            guy went to the can to take a shit. The first man said his son was
            doing so well, he now owned a factory, manufacturing furniture. Why,
            just the other day he gave his best friend a whole house full of
            brand new furniture.<br />
            <br />
            The second man said his son was doing just as well. He was a manager
            at a car sales firm. Why, just the other day he gave his best friend
            a Ferrari. The third man said his was doing well too. He was a
            manager at a bank. Why, just the other day he gave his best friend
            the money to buy a house.<br />
            <br />
            The fourth man came back, and the other three told him they were
            just talking about how successful their sons are. He just shook his
            head and said his son was gay and hadn't amounted to much. But he
            must be doing something right because, just the other day he was
            given a house, furniture and a Ferrari by his friends!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man travels to Spain and goes to a Madrid
            restaurant for a late dinner. He orders the house special and he is
            brought a plate with potatoes, corn, and two large meaty objects.
            &quot;What's this?&quot; he asks. &quot;Cojones, senor,&quot; the
            waiter replies. &quot;What are cojones?&quot; the man asks. &quot;Cojones,&quot;
            the waiter explains, &quot;are the testicles of the bull who lost at
            the arena this afternoon.&quot;</p>
            <p>At first the man is disgusted, but being the
            adventurous type, he decides to try this local delicacy. To his
            amazement, it is quite delicious. In fact, it is so good that he
            decides to come back again the next night and order it again. After
            dinner the man informed the waiter that these were better than the
            pair he had the previous afternoon but the portion was much smaller.</p>
            <p>&quot;Senor,&quot; the waiter explains,
            &quot;the bull does not lose every time.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Who is Jack Schitt you ask? The lineage is
            finally revealed. Many people are at a loss for a response when
            someone says &quot; you don't know jack schitt.&quot; Now you can
            intellectually handle the situation. Jack is the only son of Awe
            Schitt and O Schitt. Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O
            Schitt, the owner of kneedeep N. Schitt, Inc. In turn, Jack Schitt
            married Noe Schitt,&nbsp; and the deeply religious couple produced
            six children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt,Giva Schitt,Bull Schitt,
            and the twins, Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt. Against her parents'
            wishes, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout.
            After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.</p>
            <p>Noe Schitt later married Mr. Sherlock, and
            because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her
            previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock. Dip Schitt
            married Loda Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.</p>
            <p>Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable
            throughout their childhood and subsequently married the Happens
            brothers in a dual ceremony. Thewedding announcement in the
            newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding. The Schitt-Happens
            children are Dawg,Byrd, and Horse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son
            left home to tour the world, and recently returned from Italy with
            his new bride, Pisa Schitt.</p>
            <p>So now when someone says, &quot;you don't know
            Jack Schitt&quot;, you can correct them.</p>

            <p>A guy is walking past a bus stop and says to a
            woman &quot;Can I smell your cunt?&quot; &quot;Fuck off, no you
            can't smell my cunt!&quot; the woman yells back at him,
            &quot;Oh&quot; he replies, looking slightly confused, &quot;it must
            be your feet then&quot;.</p>

            <p>News Flash : Today the world was stunned by
            the news of the death of the Energizer Bunny. He was six years old.
            Authorities believe that the death occurred approximately 8:42 PM
            last evening. Best known as the irritating pink bunny that kept
            going, and going and going, &quot;Pinkie&quot; as he was known to
            his friends and family was alone at the time of his death. An
            emergency autopsy was performed early this morning. Chief Medical
            Examiner, Dura Cell, concluded that the cause of death was acute
            cardiac arrest induced by sexual over-stimulation. Apparently,
            someone had put the bunny's batteries in backwards and he kept
            coming, and coming, and&nbsp; coming...</p>

            <p>A man phones home from his office and says to
            his wife, &quot;I have the chance to go fishing for a week. It's the
            opportunity of a lifetime. I have to leave right away. Pack my
            clothes, my fishing equipment, and especially my blue silk pajamas.
            I'll be home in an hour to pick them up.&quot; The man rushes home
            to grab everything. He hugs his wife, apologizes for the short
            notice, and then hurries off.</p>
            <p>A week later, the man returns and his wife
            asks, &quot;Did you have a good trip, dear?&quot; The man replies,
            &quot;Yep, the fishing was great... but you forgot to pack my blue
            silk pajamas.&quot; His wife smiles and says, &quot;Oh, no I
            didn't... I put them in your tackle box!&quot;</p>

            <p>In a hospital serving victims of land mines, a
            little girl wakes up from surgery. Little Girl: &quot;Doctor,
            something is wrong... I can't feel my legs!&quot; Doctor: &quot;Yes,
            we've had to amputate both your arms.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>One day, after striking gold in
            Alaska, a lonesome miner came down from the mountains and walked
            into a saloon in the nearest town. &quot;I'm lookin' for the
            meanest, roughest and toughest whore in the Yukon!&quot; he said to
            the bartender. &quot;We got her!&quot; replied the barkeep.
            &quot;She's upstairs in the second room on the right.&quot; The
            miner handed the bartender a gold nugget to pay for the whore and
            two beers. He grabbed the beer bottles, stomped up the stairs,
            kicked open the second door on the right and yelled, &quot;I'm
            lookin' for the meanest, roughest and toughest whore in the
            Yukon!&quot; The woman inside the room looked at the miner and said,
            &quot;You found her!&quot; Then she stripped naked, bent over and
            grabbed her ankles. &quot;How do you know I want to do it in that
            position?&quot; asked the miner. &quot;I don't,&quot; replied the
            whore, &quot;but I thought you might like to open those beers before
            we get started.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A ranch woman takes her three
            sons to the doctor for physicals for the first time in their
            lives.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The doctor examines the boys and tells the woman that they are
            healthy but she needs to give them iron supplements. She goes home
            and wonders exactly what iron supplements are. Finally, she goes to
            the hardware store and buys iron ball bearings (BB's) and mixes them
            into their food.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Several days later the youngest son comes to her and tells her that
            he is pissing BB's. She tells him that it is normal because she had
            put them in his food. Later the middle son comes to her and says
            that he is crapping BB's. Again, she says that it is ok.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            That evening the eldest son comes in very upset. He says &quot;Ma,
            you won't believe what happened&quot;. She says &quot;I know, you're
            passing BB's&quot;. &quot;No&quot;, he says. &quot;I was out behind
            the barn jacking off and I shot the dog&quot;.</p>

            <p align="left">Three boys received their grades
            from their female sex education instructor. One got a D+, the second
            a D- and the third an F. &quot;One day we should get her for
            this,&quot; said the first boy. &quot;I agree. We&#65533;ll grab
            her...&quot; said the second. &quot;Yeah,&quot; said the third.
            &quot;And then we'll kick her in the nuts!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">There was a tour bus in Egypt
            that stopped in the middle of a town square. The tourists are all
            shopping at the little stands surrounding the square. One tourist
            looks at his watch, but it is broken, so he leans over to a local
            who is squatted down next to his camel. &quot;What time is it,
            sir?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The local reaches out and softly cups the camel's genitals in his
            hand, and raises them up and down. &quot;It's about 2:00&quot;, he
            says. The tourist can't believe what he just saw.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            He runs back to the bus, and sure enough, it is 2:00. He tells a few
            of the fellow tourists his story, &quot;The man can tell the time by
            the weight of the camel's genitals!! One of the doubting tourists
            walks back to the local and asks him the time, the same thing
            happens!! It is 2:05.p.m.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            He runs back to tell the story. Finally, the bus driver wants to
            know how it is done. He walks over and asks the local how he knows
            the time from the camel's genitals. The local says &quot;Sit down
            here and grab the camel's genitals&quot;. &quot;Now, lift them up in
            the air. Now, look underneath them to the other side of the
            courtyard, where that clock is hanging on the wall.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="left">Two young guys were picked up by
            the cops for smoking dope and appeared in court on Friday before the
            judge. The judge said, &quot;You seem like nice young men, and I'd
            like to give you a second chance rather than jail time. I want you
            to go out this weekend and try to show others the evils of drug use
            and get them to give up drugs forever. I'll see you back in court
            Monday.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Monday, the two guys were in court, and the judge said to the 1st
            one, &quot;How did you do over the weekend?&quot; &quot;Well, your
            honor, I persuaded 17 people to give up drugs forever.&quot;
            &quot;17 people? That's wonderful. What did you tell them?&quot;
            &quot;I used a diagram, your honor. I drew two circles like this...</p>
            <p align="left">o O</p>
            <p align="left">...and told them this (the big
            circle) is your brain before drugs and this (small circle) is your
            brain after drugs.&quot; &quot;That's admirable,&quot; said the
            judge.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;And you, how did you do?&quot;, he asked the second boy,
            &quot;Well, your honor, I persuaded 156 people to give up drugs
            forever.&quot; &quot;156 people! That's amazing! How did you manage
            to do that?!?&quot;, &quot;Well, I used a similar approach. (draws
            two circles)</p>
            <p align="left">O o</p>
            <p align="left">I said (pointing to the small

            <p>The grieving widow goes to her local newspaper
            to submit an obituary. The man behind the counter tells her it will
            cost $5.per word. She thinks for a moment and says &quot;Fred's

            <p>There are these three girls and their
            boyfriends all have the same name. So in order to keep them from
            getting confused, they decided to give their boyfriends nicknames.
            So they asked the first girl what she called her boyfriend. And she
            says, &quot;I call my man 7-up.&quot; They ask her,&quot; Why do you
            call your man that,&quot; and she says,&quot; Because he's seven
            inches long and is always up. They ask the second girl what she
            calls her man. She says,&quot; I call my man Mountain Dew.&quot;
            They ask,&quot; Why do you call your man that,&quot; and she
            says,&quot; Because he likes to Mount me and to Do me.&quot; They
            ask the third girl the same thing and she says, &quot;I like to call
            my man Jack Daniels.&quot; They look at her puzzled and say,&quot;
            Why do you call your man that, Jack Daniels is a Hard Liquor,&quot;
            and she says, &quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>

            <p>A baby was just born. He had all his pieces
            and looked quite normal, except that he was laughing like crazy. I
            mean laughing real hard. All the doctors and nurses were examining
            the little thing, in front of the worried parents, but he kept on
            laughing, his tiny fists all closed and tears rolling from his eyes.
            One at a time, a pediatrician unfolded the tiny fingers to check if
            the hand was all right, and... guess what he found? The birth
            control pill!</p>
