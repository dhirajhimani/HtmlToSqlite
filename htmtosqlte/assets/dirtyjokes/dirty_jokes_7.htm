            <p>Two old people, a man and a woman, walk into a
            hospital. The doctor says to the old man, &quot;I'll need a urine
            sample, a feces sample, and a blood sample.&quot; The old man says,
            &quot;What?&quot; So the doctor says it again. Once again the old
            man says, &quot;what?&quot; So the doctor yells it, &quot;I NEED A
            URINE SAMPLE, A FECES SAMPLE, AND A BLOOD SAMPLE!&quot; With that
            the old woman turns to the old man and says, &quot;He needs a pair
            of your underwear!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A new bride went to her doctor for a check up.
            Lacking knowledge of the male anatomy, she asked the doctor
            &quot;What's that thing hanging between my husbands legs?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The doctor replies &quot;We call that the penis.&quot; The new bride
            then asks &quot;What's that reddish/purple thing on the end of the
            penis?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The doctor replies &quot;We call that the head of the penis. The
            bride then asks &quot;What are those 2 round things about 15 inches
            from the head of the penis?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The doctor replies &quot;Lady, on him I don't know, but on me
            they're the cheeks of my ass!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Burford is checking out of a hotel when
            suddenly he has to take a shit real bad. The toilet in his room
            isn't working, so he bolts down to use the lobby Men's Room, but all
            of the stalls are occupied, so he runs back up to his room, and in
            desperation, he drops his pants, uproots a plant, and takes a shit
            in the pot. Then he puts the plant back in the pot and leaves. Two
            weeks later, he gets a postcard from the hotel that says,<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Dear Mr. Burford... All is forgiven. Just tell us...where it
            is?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A couple were indulged in sexual intercourse
            and the man noticed that with each movement of his pelvis, his
            partner's toes would rise.<br />
            <br />
            Later that night, while going at it pretty hot and heavy in the
            shower, her toes remained still. Confused, he asked, &quot;Why is it
            that when we do it in bed, your toes go up, but when we do it in the
            shower, they don't?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Silly,&quot; she replied, &quot;I take my pantyhose off in the
            shower!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>So this older guy goes to the doctor asking
            for a prescription for 'Viagra'. The guy asks for a large dose of
            the *strongest* variety. The doctor asks why he needs so much. The
            guy says that two young nymphomaniacs are spending a week at his
            place. The doctor fills the prescription.<br />
            <br />
            Later that week, the same guy goes back to the doctor asking for
            pain killers. The doctor asks 'why, is your dick in that much
            pain?', 'no', says the guy, 'it's for my wrists - the girls never
            showed up!'</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man is driving his eighteen wheeler down the
            road, when he sees a hitch hiker. So the trucker stops and picks up
            the man. While they are driving down the road, the trucker says
            &quot;Hey man, you wanna see something pretty cool?&quot; The hitch
            hiker says sure. So the trucker has this monkey in the back, and he
            makes it come up with the men, and he smacks the monkey up side his
            head, and the monkey gives him a blow job. So after that, the
            trucker says &quot;Hey man, do you want some of that?&quot; And the
            hitch hiker says &quot;Sure, but just don't smack me so hard.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>One winter year, these two little fleas headed
            for the warm sunny beaches of California to escape the cold. The
            first flea got there and started rubbing suntan lotion on his little
            flea arms and his little flee legs. Just then, the second flea
            arrived just a shiverin' and a shakin'. The first flea asked,
            &quot;What the hell happened to you?&quot;&nbsp; To which the second
            flea replied &quot;I just rode out here on a bikers mustache and I'm
            so very coldddd!&quot; The first flea said, &quot;Don't you know the
            special trick to gettin here, first you go to the airport, go
            straight to the ladies cammode, wait for a pretty young stewardess
            to come along, and when she sits down you climb right up in there
            where its nice and warm&quot;. The second flea agreed that this was
            a grand idea. The next winter comes along and it was time for the
            fleas to head for the sunny beaches again. The first flea arrived
            and began putting suntan lotion on his little flea arms and his
            little flea legs. About that time, the second flea arrived again
            just a shiverin', shakin', and mumbling about how cold he was. The
            first flea exclaimed &quot;Didn't you learn anything that I taught
            you about getting here nice and warm?&quot; To which the second flea
            replied, &quot;I did just as you said; I went to the ladies cammode
            and this pretty stewardess came in and sat down, I climbed right up
            in there and it was so very warm. Next thing I know we stop at a bar
            and I fell asleep. All of a sudden I woke and there I was, right
            back on that bikers mustache!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>To men dicussing how tight ass cold their
            wives had been to them about giving sex. The first fellow says
            &quot;My wife's so cold I can put a glass of water in bed with her
            and the next morning its turned to ice.&quot; The second fellow says
            &quot;Hell, every time my old lady spreads her legs the furnace
            kicks in!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>One evening this drunk walks into a bar, sits
            down, and happens to notice a 12&quot; tall man standing on the bar.
            Astonished, the man asks the guy next to him; &quot;What the hell is
            that?&quot; The guy next to him replies &quot;He's a pianist!&quot;,
            to which the drunk replied &quot;Horse shit, your pulling my
            leg&quot; So the guy next to him picks up the 12&quot; man , grabs
            some books, and props the little man up to the piano. Sure enough,
            this little man started hammerin out all the favorite tunes of the
            bars' patrons. Stunned, the drunk asks &quot;That little guy is
            cool, where the hell did you get him&quot;? The fella told the drunk
            how he had found a genie bottle out in the alley, rubbed it til a
            genie appeared, and was granted one wish. All of a sudden the drunk
            hauls ass out the back door, finds the bottle, and starts rubbing
            it: when all of a sudden a genie pops out and grants him one wish.
            In a slur, the drunk asks &quot;I wish for a million bucks&quot;.
            All of a sudden, the sky turns black and overhead a million ducks
            come flying overhead shittin all over him. Angrily, the drunk runs
            back inside, slams the door and begins cursing &quot;You son of a
            bitch, I found that genie bottle and wished for a million bucks and
            all of a sudden there are a million ducks shitting all over my new
            suit.&quot; The fella started laughing and wildly exclaimed
            &quot;You don't really think I wished for a 12&quot; pianist do
            you?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This retarded kid is starting his first day of
            school. He walks down to the bus stop and waits for the bus to take
            him to school. The bus eventually drives up and opens the door.
            &quot;Hello Mr Schoolbus Driver&quot; he says in a slurred voice.
            Then the bus door closes and drives off without picking him up. He
            went back home, told his parents and figured he would try again.<br />
            <br />
            The next morning, he stood at the bus stop, the bus came around and
            opened the door. In a slurred voice the boy says ,&quot;Hello Mr
            Busdriver!&quot; To which the bus driver closed the door and drove
            off.<br />
            <br />
            The boy went back to his parents and told them, to which they were
            majorly pissed off. The next morning, they came down with the boy to
            the bus stop to talk to the driver. The bus came past and the door
            opened. The father of the boy asks, &quot;My boy needs to go to
            school each morning, but you keep closing the door and driving off,
            how come?&quot;. The bus driver says in a slurred voice, &quot;He
            keeps making fun of me!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man was driving down an Alaskan road and his
            car broke down. He phoned the Alaskan Mobile Fixit Service and they
            arrived shortly after. He service man opened the bonnet and after a
            while the repair man said &quot; It looks like you've blown a seal
            &quot;, the man replies &quot;No, it's just frost on my
            moustache.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The doc told him that masturbating before sex
            often helped men last longer during the act. The man decided,
            &quot;What the hell, I'll try it,&quot;He spent the rest of the day
            thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office. He
            thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an
            alley, but figured that was too unsafe. Finally, he realized his
            solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of
            the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was
            examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants
            and started to masturbate.<br />
            <br />
            He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to
            orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting
            to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and
            replied, &quot;What?&quot; He heard, &quot;This is the police.
            What's going on down there?&quot; The man replied, &quot;I'm
            checking out the rear axle, it's busted.&quot; Came the reply,
            &quot;Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're
            down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes
            ago.&quot;</p>

            <p>After thirty-five years of marriage, Bernie is
            lying on his deathbed and with a tear in his eye he says
            &quot;Annabel before I die I have to tell you something&quot;. She
            replies &quot;Yes, yes dear anything what is it?&quot; He starts,
            &quot;The first year we were together, I caught pneumonia and almost
            died. You sat by my bed and nursed me back to health.&quot; To which
            the wife nods her head and he continues, &quot;When I lost half my
            family in the terrible car crash, it was you by my side who kept me
            going. When our kids grew up and ran away from home, you sat with me
            and comforted me! And when I lost everything last year in the fire
            at the store, you were right by my side the whole time. Annabel
            You've been through everything with me.&quot; Bernie says, &quot;So
            before I die I just want you to know you're a fucking jinx!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was a boy playing in the farm field when
            his mom called him in for breakfast. On his way in he kicked a cow,
            pig, and a chicken. So when he gets to the table he sees a dry bowl
            of cereal. &quot;What's the deal?&quot; he asks. His mom says &quot;
            You kicked the cow so no milk for you, you kicked the pig so no
            bacon for you, and you kicked the chicken so no eggs for you.&quot;
            Then his father walks into the kitchen and accidentally kicked the
            cat. The the boy says &quot;Do you want me to tell him or should
            you?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man took his pregnant wife to the hospital.
            The doctor looked her over and told them it would be a rather
            difficult delivery. He offered to let the couple try an experimental
            procedure. The woman would be connected to a machine that would
            transfer part of the pain to the father of the baby, thus reducing
            her own. The man quickly agreed. The doctor warned him, though, that
            there was a slight bug in the machine that caused it to amplify the
            pain sent to the father by ten times, and if the pain became too
            much for to bear would he please let the doctor know.<br />
            <br />
            The doctor turned on the machine and watched the man. The man said
            he felt absolutely fine and he could take more. The doctor turned
            the dial up to 40, 60, 80, and finally 100% of the pain, times ten.
            The woman delivered the baby painlessly and the doctor stared at the
            man, astonished at how he could not even flinch with that much pain
            brought upon him.<br />
            <br />
            The couple took the new baby home. There, on the front step, the
            mailman lay dead.</p>
