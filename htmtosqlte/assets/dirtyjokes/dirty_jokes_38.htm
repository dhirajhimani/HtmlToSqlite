           <p>Teacher: &quot;Johnny, can you tell me the name of 3 great kings who have brought happiness and peace into people's lives?&quot;</p>
           <p>Little Johnny: Drin-king, smo-king, and fuc-king. </p>

           <p>A farmhand is driving around the farm, checking the fences. After a few minutes   he radios his boss and says, &quot;Boss, I've got a problem. I hit a pig on the road   and he's stuck in the bull-bars of my truck. He's still wriggling. What should I   do?&quot; <br />
             <br />
&quot;In the back of your truck there's a shotgun. Shoot the pig in the   head and when it stops wriggling you can pull it out and throw it in a bush.&quot;   The farm worker says okay and signs off. About 10 minutes later he radios back.   &quot;Boss I did what you said, I shot the pig and dragged it out and threw it in a   bush.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's the problem now?&quot; his Boss snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;The blue   light on his motorcycle is still flashing!&quot; </p>

           <p>Tony had just finished reading a new book entitled, 'You Can Be The Man of Your House.'</p>
           <p>He stormed to his wife in the kitchen and announced, 'From now on, you need to know that I am the man of this house and my word is Law. You will prepare me a gourmet meal tonight, and when I'm finished eating my meal, you will serve me a sumptuous dessert. </p>
           <p>After dinner, you are going to go upstairs with me and we will have the kind of sex that I want. Afterwards, you are going to draw me a bath so I can relax. You will wash my back and towel me dry and bring me my robe. </p>
           <p>Then, you will massage my feet and hands. Then tomorrow, guess who's going to dress me and comb my hair?'</p>
           <p>His Sicilian wife Gina replied, &quot;The fucking funeral director would be my first guess.&quot; </p>

           <p>A magician worked on a cruise ship. The audience was different        each week, so the magician did the same tricks over and over again.</p>
           <p>There was one problem. The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the show &quot;Look, it's not the same hat!&quot; or, &quot;Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table,&quot; or &quot;Hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?&quot;</p>
           <p>The magician was furious, but couldn't do anything. It was, after 
             all, the captain's parrot. Then the ship sank. The magician found        himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the sea with, as fate        would have it, the parrot. </p>
           <p>They stared at each other with hatred, but did not utter a word.        This went on for a day and then another and then another. </p>
           <p>Finally on the fourth day, the parrot could not        hold back and said, <br />
           </p>
           <p>&quot;OK, I give up. Where's the fucking ship?&quot;</p>

           <p>This letter was sent to the School Principal's office after the school had sponsored a luncheon for seniors. An elderly lady received  a new radio at the lunch as a door raffle prize and was writing to say thank  you. </p>
           <p>Dear Lions Bay School,<br />
           </p>
           <p>God bless you for the beautiful radio I won at your recent Senior Citizens luncheon. I am 87 years old and live at  the West Vancouver Home for the Aged. All of my family has passed  away so I am all alone. I want to thank you for the kindness you have shown to a forgotten old lady.</p>
           <p>My roommate is 95 and has always had her own radio; but, she would never let me listen to it. She said it belonged to her long dead husband, and understandably, wanted to keep it safe.</p>
           <p>The other day her radio fell off the nightstand and broke into a dozen pieces. It was awful and she was in tears. <br />
             She asked if she could listen to mine, and I was overjoyed that I could tell her to fuck off.</p>
           <p>Thank you for that wonderful opportunity.</p>
           <p>God bless you all.</p>
           <p>Sincerely,<br />
           </p>

           <p>A first-grade teacher, Ms Brooks, was having trouble with one of her students. The teacher asked, 'Harry, what's your problem?' </p>
           <p>Harry answered, 'I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!' </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. </p>
           <p>While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed. </p>
           <p>Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. </p>
           <p>Principal: <br />
             'What is 3 x 3?'</p>
           <p>Harry: <br />
             '9.' </p>
           <p>Principal: <br />
             'What is 6 x 6?' </p>
           <p>Harry: <br />
             '36.'</p>
           <p>And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. </p>
           <p>The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, 'I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade' </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks says to the principal, 'Let me ask him some questions..' </p>
           <p>The principal and Harry both agreed. </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks asks, 'What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?' </p>
           <p>Harry, after a moment: 'Legs.' </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks: 'What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?' </p>
           <p>The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! </p>
           <p>Harry replied: 'Pockets.' </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks: 'What does a dog do that a man steps into?' </p>
           <p>Harry: 
             'Pants.' </p>
           <p>The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.</p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks: 'What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?' </p>
           <p>The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, 'Bubble gum.' </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks: 'What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?'</p>
           <p>Harry: 'Shake hands .' </p>
           <p>The principal was trembling. </p>
           <p>Ms. Brooks: 'What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?' </p>
           <p>Harry: <br />
             'Firetruck.' </p>
           <p>The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the <br />
             teacher, 'Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong. <br />

           <p>A woman is learning how to golf. She has been teaching herself to play for more than three months and she is really bad. She decides to consult a golf pro.</p>
           <p>When she sees the golf pro, she explains how bad she is and he tells her to go ahead and hit the ball. She does. The ball goes about 50 yards into the brush slicing to the right. The golf pro says to the woman, &quot;I can see that you have a lot of problems. Your stance is bad, your head is all over the place, and the worst thing is that grip.&quot;</p>
           <p>When she asks what can be done to fix the situation, he suggests, &quot;Grab the club gently, as if you were grabbing your husband's &quot;club&quot;. When the feeling is right, go ahead and swing.&quot; She does just that and the ball goes off the tee perfectly straight for about 275 yards.</p>
           <p>The golf pro says to the woman, &quot;That is unbelievable, I didn't think you would do that well. But now on to your next problem... How are we going to get that golf club out of your mouth?&quot;<br />
           </p>

           <p>An old man is walking down the street one afternoon when he sees a woman with perfect breasts.</p>
           <p>He says to her, &quot;Hey miss, would  you let me BITE your breasts for $100?&quot;</p>
           <p>&quot;Are you nuts?!&quot; she replies, and keeps walking away. <br />
             <br />
             He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does. &quot;Would you  let me bite your breasts for $1,000?&quot; he  asks again.</p>
           <p>&quot;Listen you; I'm not that kind of woman! Got it?&quot;<br />
             <br />
             So the little old man runs around the next block and faces her  again, &quot;Would you let me bite your breasts -  just once - for $10,000?!&quot;<br />
  <br />
             She thinks  about it for a while and says, &quot;Hmmmmm, $10,000... Ok, just once, but not here. Let's  go to that dark alley over there.&quot;<br />
  <br />
             So they go  into the alley, where she takes off her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world. </p>
           <p>As soon as he sees them, he grabs them and starts caressing them, fondling them slowly, kissing them, licking them, burying his face in  them - but not biting them.</p>
           <p>The woman  finally gets annoyed and asks, 'Well? Are you  gonna bite them or not?'<br />
  &quot;Nah,&quot; says the little old man... &quot;Costs too much!&quot;<br />

           <p>Four Catholic men and a Catholic woman were having coffee.</p>
           <p>The first Catholic man tells his friends, &quot;My son is a priest, when he walks into a room, everyone calls him 'Father'.&quot;<br />
             <br />
             The second Catholic man chirps, &quot;My son is a Bishop. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Grace'.&quot;</p>
           <p>The third Catholic gent says, &quot;My son is a Cardinal.. When he enters a roomeveryone says 'Your Eminence'.&quot;</p>
           <p>The fourth Catholic man then says, &quot;My son is the Pope. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Holiness'.&quot;</p>
           <p>Since the lone Catholic woman was sipping her coffee in silence, the four men give her a subtle, &quot;Well....?&quot;<br />
             <br />
             She proudly replies, &quot;I have a daughter, slim, tall, 38D breast, 24&quot; waist and 34&quot; hips. When she walks into a room, people say, &quot;Oh My God.&quot;<br />

           <p>A young couple got married and went on their honeymoon.</p>
           <p>When they got back, the bride immediately called her mother.</p>
           <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her mother, &quot;how was the honeymoon?&quot;</p>
           <p>&quot;Oh, mama,&quot; she replied, &quot;the honeymoon as wonderful! So romantic...&quot;</p>
           <p>Suddenly she burst out crying. &quot;But, mama, as soon as we returned Sam started using the most horrible language - things I'd never heard before!<br />
             I mean, all these awful 4-letter words! You've got to take me home... PLEASE MAMA!&quot;</p>
           <p>&quot;Sarah, Sarah,&quot; her mother said, &quot;calm down! You need to stay with your husband and work this out. Now, tell me, what could be so awful? WHAT 4-letter words?&quot;</p>
           <p>&quot;Please don't make me tell you, mama,&quot; wept the daughter, &quot;I'm so embarrassed they're just too awful! COME GET ME, PLEASE!!&quot;</p>
           <p>&quot;Darling, baby, you must tell me what has you so upset. Tell your mother these horrible 4-letter words!&quot;</p>
           <p>Still sobbing, the bride said, &quot;Oh, Mama ... he used words like: dust, wash, iron, cook...&quot;</p>
           <p>&quot;I'll pick you up in twenty minutes,&quot; said the mother.</p>

           <p>An elderly man goes into his doctors office for an annual physical. After a while, the doctor comes out and says, &quot;I'm sorry Bill, but we have discovered you have a condition which only allows you another 6 weeks to live.&quot; </p>
           <p>&quot;But Doctor,&quot; Bill replied, &quot;I feel great. I haven't felt better in years. This just can't be true. Isn't there anything I can do?&quot; </p>
           <p>After a moment the doctor said, &quot;Well, you might start going down the street to that new health spa and take a mud bath every day.&quot; </p>
           <p>Excitedly Bill asked, &quot;And that will cure me?&quot; </p>
           <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the doctor, &quot;but it will get you used to the dirt.&quot;</p>

           <p>A married man was having an affair with his secretary. One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house, where they made passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the wild sex, they fell asleep, awakening around 8:00 pm. As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt. Mystified, she nonetheless complied. He slipped into his shoes and drove home. </p>
<p>&quot;Where have you been?&quot; demanded his wife when he entered the house. </p>
           <p>&quot;Darling, I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until eight o'clock.&quot; </p>
           <p>The wife glanced down at his shoes and said, &quot;You lying bastard! You've been playing golf!&quot;.</p>
