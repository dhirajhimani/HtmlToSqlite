            <p>Cinderella wanted to go to the ball one night,
            but she didn't have any tampons to use and she was on the rags. Her
            Fairy Godmother came to the rescue and turned a pumpkin next to
            Cinderella's house into a tampon. The Godmother says, &quot;Now use
            the tampon, but be sure to get back home before midnight or it will
            turn back into a pumpkin, and that wouldn't be good.&quot;
            Cinderella agrees and leaves the house.<br />
            <br />
            Midnight comes along...no Cinderella, 1am, 2am and 3am, still no
            Cinderella!<br />
            <br />
            Finally, 5am rolls by and Cinderella waltzes through the door and
            the fairy godmother jumps up. &quot;Where the hell have you
            been?!?&quot; To which Cinderella replies, &quot;I met this amazing
            guy, and well, before I knew it, we got into a serious bang session.
            His name was Peter Peter.....&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This guy decides to join the Navy. On his
            first day of service, he gets aquatinted with all the facilities
            around the ship he will be serving on. The guy asks the sailor
            showing him around, &quot;What do you guys do around here when you
            get really horny after months of being out at sea?&quot;, to which
            the other replies, &quot;Well, there is this barrel on the upper
            deck, just pump your cock in the side with the hole.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Weeks pass, and the new guy is getting real horny and remembers the
            barrel. He climbs to upper deck and sees the barrel. Flings his
            shlong out and starts fucking the barrel. Its simply the best
            feeling he had ever experienced, it was truly a success!<br />
            <br />
            After he was done, zipped up and merrily walking along, the guy who
            originally told him about the barrel walks by. &quot;That barrel
            really was great! I could do it every day!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            To which the other crew member replies, &quot;Yeah, you can every
            day except Thursday.&quot; Confused, the new guy asks why, to which
            the other guy replies, &quot;Because its your turn in the barrel on
            Thursday.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Jason walks into a restroom in an airport and
            goes up to a urinal. A man with no arms comes up to him and says
            &quot;Hey, can you give me a hand?&quot;. Though he feels
            uncomfortable, he agrees to help. He unzips the man's pants, takes a
            deep breath, and reaches in and takes out his penis, which he is
            horrified to discover is all green and moldy. Imagining the bonus he
            will get come judgment day, he continues to hold the man's moldy
            unit as he urinates, gives it a shake, and zips it back up in his
            pants.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Hey, thanks a lot man.&quot; The man says<br />
            <br />
            &quot;No problem. But there is one thing I have to know, what is
            wrong with your Johnson?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Then the man pulls his arms out into his sleeves and says &quot;I
            don't know, but I'm sure as hell ain't gonna touch it!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A very good looking man walks into a singles
            bar, gets a drink and has a seat. During the course of the evening
            he tries to chat with every single woman who walks into the bar,
            with no luck. Suddenly a really ugly man, and I mean R-E-A-L-L-Y
            ugly man walks into the bar. He sits at the bar, and within seconds
            he is surrounded by women. Very soon he walks out of the bar with
            the two of the most beautiful women you ever saw. Disheartened by
            all this, the good looking man asks the barman, 'Excuse me, but that
            really ugly man just came in here and left with those two stunning
            women - what's his secret? He's as ugly as sin and I'm everything a
            girl could want but have not been able to connect all night - What's
            going on?' 'Well,' Said the Barman, 'I don't know how he does it,
            but he does the same thing every night. He walks in, orders a drink,
            and just sits there licking his eyebrows...'</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and his wife got into bed for the night.
            The wife had curled up ready for sleep and the husband put his bed
            lamp on to read a book. As he was reading, he stopped and reached
            over to his wife and started fondling her pussy. He did this only
            for a very short while then stopped and went back to reading his
            book.<br />
            <br />
            The wife got up and started stripping in front of him. The husband
            was confused and asked, &quot;What the hell are doing, taking all
            your jammies off?&quot; The wife replied, &quot;You were playing
            with my pussy. I thought it was foreplay for<br />
            something a bit heavier&quot;.<br />
            <br />
            The husband said, &quot;Hell no! I was just wetting my fingers so I
            could turn the pages.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A lady goes to the doctor's office and tells
            the doctor that she can't get her husband to have sex with her
            anymore. So, the doctor gives her some pills and says to give her
            husband one each night in his dinner whenever she wants to have sex.
            That night she gave him one and they had a decent night of sex. The
            next night she decided to try 4 pills and she had even better sex.
            Well the next night she tried 8 pills and the sex was wonderful. So
            the next night she decided to dump the whole bottle in his dinner.
            The next day her son showed up at the doctor's office and and said,
            &quot;Doctor, Doctor, what did you do to my Daddy? My mom's dead, my
            sister's pregnant, my butt hurts, and my dad's going around saying
            here kitty, kitty, kitty!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was a papa mole, a mamma mole, and a
            baby mole. They lived in a hole out in the country near a farmhouse.
            Papa mole poked his head out of the hole and said, &quot;Mmmm, I
            smell sausage!&quot; Mamma mole poked her head outside the hole and
            said, &quot;Mmmm, I smell pancakes!&quot; Baby mole tried to stick
            his head outside but couldn't because of the two bigger moles. Baby
            mole said, &quot;The only thing I smell is molasses.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Once there were twin brothers by the name of
            Jones. John Jones was married, and Joe Jones was single. The single
            brother Joe was the proud owner of a dilapidated row boat. It
            happened that John Jone's wife died the same day that Joe's rowboat
            filled with water and sank.<br />
            <br />
            A few days later, a kindly old lady met Joe and mistaken him for
            John said; &quot;Oh Mr. Jones, I am sorry to hear of your great
            loss, you must feel terrible&quot;.<br />
            <br />
            Joe smiled and said, &quot;Well I am not a bit sorry, she was rather
            old from the start. Her bottom was all chewed up and she smelled of
            dead fish. Even the first time I got into her, she made water faster
            than anything I ever saw. She had a bad crack and a pretty big hole
            in her front, and that hole got bigger every time I used her. It got
            so I could barely handle her, but if anyone else used her she leaked
            like anything. The thing that finished her was four guys from the
            other side of town. They came down looking for a good time and asked
            if I could lend her to them. I warned them she wasn't so hot, but
            they could take a crack at her if they liked. Well, the result was
            the crazy fools tried to get inside her all at once and it was too
            much for her. She cracked right up the middle&quot;.<br />
            <br />
            Before he could finish the old lady fainted!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The kindergarten class had a homework
            assignment to find out about something exciting and relate it to the
            class the next day. When the time came for the little kids to give
            their reports, the teacher was calling on them one at a time. She
            was reluctant to call upon little Johnnie, knowing that he sometimes
            could be a bit crude. But eventually his turn came. Little Johnnie
            walked up to the front of the class, and with a piece of chalk, made
            a small white dot on the blackboard, then sat back down. Well the
            teacher couldn't figure out what Johnnie had in mind for his report,
            so she asked him just what that was. &quot;It's a period,&quot;
            reported Johnnie. &quot;Well I can see that,&quot; she said,
            &quot;But what is so exciting about a period.&quot; &quot;Damned if
            I know,&quot; said Johnnie, &quot;But this morning my sister said
            she missed one. Then Daddy had a heart attack, Mommy fainted and the
            man next door shot himself.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A kindergarten teacher comes to class and
            says, &quot;Today class I am going to give you a letter of the
            alphabet and I want you to give me a word that begins with that
            letter.&quot; She begins with the letter &quot;A&quot; and all the
            kids raise their hands. There is one kid in the back named Johnny
            that is real eager to answer the question, but the teacher knows
            that he is always vulgar and likes to use obscenities so she chooses
            on little Mary to answer. Mary stands and says,
            &quot;A...Apple&quot; The teacher replies, &quot;That's great, Mary,
            good job.&quot; So she moves on to the letter &quot;B&quot;, and
            again Johnny is still eager to answer the question, but the teacher
            is sure that he will probably say &quot;Bitch&quot; or something
            like that so she calls on Todd. Todd says, &quot;B...Baseball.&quot;
            And the teacher replies, &quot;Good Job, Todd.&quot; So they start
            going through the alphabet and the class' attention dwindles, except
            for Johnny. The teacher comes to the letter &quot;R&quot; and no
            one, except for Johnny, is raising their hand so she is forced to
            call on him. &quot;Okay Johnny, what starts with R?&quot; she says.
            &quot;R...Rat&quot; Johnny replies. &quot;Rat, ...that's
            it...rat?&quot; the teacher questions with astonishment.
            &quot;Yeah,&quot; says Johnny, &quot;Big-ass mother-fuckin' rat with
            a dick 12 inches long.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>John invited his mother over for dinner.
            During the meal, his mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful
            John's roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship
            between John and his roommate and this only made her more curious.
            Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she
            started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate
            than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered,
            &quot;I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and
            I are just roommates.&quot; About a week later, Julie came to John
            and said, &quot;Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been
            unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. &quot;You don't
            suppose she took it, do you?&quot; Julie said, &quot;Well, I doubt
            it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure.&quot; So he sat
            down and wrote: &quot;Dear Mother, I'm not saying you 'did' take a
            gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you 'did not' take a
            gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever
            since you were here for dinner.&quot; Several days later, John
            received a letter from his mother which read: &quot;Dear Son, I'm
            not saying that you 'do' sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that
            you 'do not' sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was
            sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by
            now. Love, Mom&quot;</p>

            <p>An old lady in a nursing home is wheeling up
            and down the halls in her wheelchair making sounds like she's
            driving a car. As she's going down the hall an old man jumps out of
            a room and says, &quot;Excuse me ma'am but you were speeding. Can I
            see your driver's license?&quot; She digs around in her purse a
            little, pulls out a candy wrapper, and hands it to him. He looks it
            over, gives her a warning and sends her on her way.</p>
            <p>Up and down the halls she goes again. Again,
            the same old man jumps out of a room and says, &quot;Excuse me ma'am
            but I saw you cross the center line back there.&quot; &quot;Can I
            see your registration please?&quot; She digs around in her purse a
            little, pulls out a store receipt and hands it to him. He looks it
            over, gives her another warning and sends her on her way.</p>
            <p>She zooms off again up and down the halls
            weaving all over. As she comes to the old man's room again he jumps
            out. This time, he's stark naked and has an erection! The old lady
            in the wheel chair looks up and says, &quot;Oh no...... not the
            Breathalyzer again!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was a shoe sales man sitting in his
            store when a beautiful woman comes in. He looks at her and can't
            stop staring. While helping her try on a pair of shoes he glances up
            her skirt to find she isn't wearing any panties. He started thinking
            and something slipped out. The man said &quot;I'd like to fill your
            pussy with ice cream and lick it all out!&quot; Hearing this the
            woman runs out to tell her husband. She says, &quot;Honey, this shoe
            salesman said he'd like to fill my pussy up with ice cream and lick
            it all out!&quot; &quot;Now go kick his ass!&quot;. The husband
            replied &quot;Dear, anyone that can eat that much ice cream, I ain't
            fuckin' with!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Once there was an old man sitting on a bench
            in the park crying. A younger man walked up to him and asked
            &quot;What's wrong?&quot; The old man replied &quot;I am married to
            a sexy 21 year old woman who gives me two blowjobs a day and we have
            sex the minute I get home from work and right after dinner.&quot;
            The young man had a strange look on his face and asked &quot;What's
            so bad about that? It sounds to me like you have a great sex
            life.&quot; The old man replied &quot;I can't remember where I
            live!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy was playing golf, a golf ball hit him in
            the balls and he passed out. His friends took him to the doctor. The
            man asked him, &quot;Well, what do you think, doc?&quot; The doctor
            replied,&quot; We're going to have to put in a support for about a
            week.&quot; He then takes four tongue depressors and ties them all
            together with string. The man's face looked disappointed, he told
            the doctor &quot;But tonight's me and my wife's honeymoon.&quot; The
            doctor replied, &quot;Your going to have to bear with it.&quot;
            Later that night, the man and his wife were in bed. She took off her
            shirt and grabs her breasts, &quot;No one has ever seen these
            before.&quot; The man pulls out his wang and says, &quot;Well mines
            still in the crate!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>George was planning on going out with
            &quot;The Boys&quot; when his wife told him that he wasn't leaving
            the house.<br />
            <br />
            George's Wife: &quot;The last time you went out with your friends
            you got so drunk that you puked on your shirt.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            George: &quot;But Honey, I promise that I wont drink a drop of
            alcohol all night!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So after begging his old lady for an hour, George got the OK the go
            out with the guys as long as he stayed off of the booze.<br />
            <br />
            George met up with the guys at a local bar and proceeded to get
            shit-faced. After about 3 hours of guzzling liquor, George blew chow
            all over his shirt.<br />
            <br />
            George: &quot;Shit! The old lady is going to throw my ass out of the
            house for getting drunk and puking on my new shirt!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Bill, George's best pal, gave drunk ass George an idea of how to
            keep from getting in trouble with the wife.<br />
            <br />
            Bill: &quot;All you got to do is have a $20 bill in your hand when
            you walk through the door. Then, when she accuses you of barfing all
            over yourself, just tell her that some other drunk puked on you and
            that he gave you 20 bucks to get the shirt cleaned.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So, when drunk ass George walked into the house with money in hand,
            his wife was waiting for him in the living room.<br />
            <br />
            Georges wife: &quot;I knew that your drunk ass would spew bile and
            booze all over that new shirt!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            George: &quot;Honey, let me explain! This drunken fool at the bar
            puked on me and gave me 20 bucks to have it cleaned.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            His wife snatched the money out of his hand and observed that he was
            holding two $20 bills.<br />
            <br />
            George's wife: &quot;Is that so? Then where did the other 20 dollar
            bill come from?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            George: &quot;Oh, That's from the guy who shit in my pants.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>During her annual checkup, the
            well-constructed miss was asked to disrobe and climb onto the
            examining table. &quot;Doctor,&quot; she replied shyly, &quot;I just
            can't undress in front of you.&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; said the
            physician, &quot;I'll flick off the lights. You undress and tell me
            when you're through.&quot; In a few moments, her voice rang out in
            the darkness: &quot;Doctor, I've undressed. What shall I do with my
            clothes?&quot; &quot;Put them on the chair, on top of mine.&quot;</p>
