            <p>A patient awakened after a serious operation 
            only to find herself in a room with all the blinds drawn. Why are 
            all the blinds closed?&quot; she asked her doctor. Well, the surgeon 
            responded, &quot;They're fighting a huge fire across the street, and we 
            didn't want you to wake up and think the operation had failed.&quot;</p>

            <p>Young Bill was courting Mabel, who lived on an 
            adjoining farm out west in cattle country. One evening, as they were 
            sitting on Bill's porch watching the sun go down over the hills, 
            Bill spied his prize bull fucking one of his cows. He sighed in 
            contentment at this idyllic rural scene and figured the omens were 
            right for him to put the hard word on Mabel. He leaned in close and 
            whispered in her ear, &quot;Mabel, I'd sure like to be doing what that 
            bull is doing.&quot; &quot;Well then, why don't you? &quot;Mabel whispered back. 
            &quot;It is YOUR cow.&quot;</p>

            <p>A young man excitedly tells his mother he's 
            fallen in love and is going to get married. He says, &quot;Just for fun, 
            Ma, I'm going to bring over three women and you try and guess which 
            one I'm going to marry.&quot; The mother agrees. The next day, he brings 
            three beautiful women into the house and sits them down on the couch 
            and they chat for a while. He then says, &quot;Okay, Ma. Guess which one 
            I'm going to marry.&quot; She immediately replies, &quot;The red-head in the 
            middle.&quot; Stunned, the young man says, &quot;That's amazing, Ma. You're 
            right. How did you know?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I don't like her,&quot; she says.</p>

            <p>A married couple was on holiday in Pakistan. 
            They were touring around the marketplace looking at the goods and 
            such, when they passed a small sandal shop. From inside they heard a 
            gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, &quot;You foreigners! Come in. 
            Come into my humble shop.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So the couple walked in and the shopkeeper says to them, &quot;I have 
            some special sandals I think you would be interested in. They have 
            special power. Dey make you wild at sex like a great desert camel.&quot; 
            Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after 
            what the shopkeeper claimed, but her husband felt he really didn't 
            need them, being the sex God he was.<br />
            <br />
            The husband asked the man, &quot;How could sandals improve my abilities?&quot; 
            The Pakistani man replied, &quot;Just try dem on, Saiheeb. The sandals 
            will prove it to you.&quot; Well, the husband, after much badgering from 
            his wife, finally conceded to try them on. As soon as he slipped 
            them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes; something his 
            wife hadn't seen in many years: raw sexual power!<br />
            <br />
            In a blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
            him violently over a table, yanked down the man's pants and his own, 
            and grabbed firm hold of the Pakistani's thighs. The Pakistani then 
            began screaming, &quot;YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!&quot;</p>

            <p>A captain of his ship was sailing the seas one 
            afternoon, when suddenly over the horizon a pirate ship was seen. 
            The captain yells &quot;Everyone prepare for battle, and hand me my red 
            jacket.&quot; To which one of the crew members complied and handed him 
            his jacket which he put on. The battle ended victoriously for the 
            ship and his captain and they continued on in their voyage. Later, 
            they again spotted pirates, this time two ships were a approaching. 
            &quot;Men, we must go to battle again! Someone get me my red jacket!&quot; And 
            a crew member brought the jacket and the captain put it on. After a 
            fierce war, and a truly stunning effort of the ships crew, the 
            pirates were defeated. Noticing a trend, one of the ships crew 
            members approaches the captain, &quot;Why is it every time we go to war 
            with another ship, you request to wear your red jacket?&quot; To which 
            the captain replies, &quot;Well, if for some reason I should be injured 
            and bleed, the red jacket will not show my wounds and thus the crew 
            will not be alarmed and worried of my condition.&quot; The crew member 
            agrees that this is a good strategy and continues with his work. 
            Later that day over the horizon, a massive fleet of pirate ships, 10 
            in all, come over the horizon. The nervous crew looks up at the 
            captain and he yells &quot;Everyone prepare for battle, and hand me my 
            brown pants!&quot;</p>

            <p>The tour bus traveling through northern Nevada 
            passed briefly at the Mustang Ranch, near Sparks. The guide noted: 
            &quot;We are now passing the largest house of prostitution in America.&quot; A 
            male passenger shouted &quot;WHY?!?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A couple, both age 78, went to a sex 
            therapist's office. The doctor asked, &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; The 
            man said, &quot;Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?&quot; The doctor 
            looked puzzled, but agreed. When the couple finished, the doctor 
            said, &quot;There's nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse,&quot; and 
            charged them $50. This happened several weeks in a row. The couple 
            would make an appointment, have intercourse with no problems, pay 
            the doctor, then leave. Finally the doctor asked, &quot;Just exactly what 
            are you trying to find out?&quot; The old man said, &quot;We're not trying to 
            find out anything. She's married and we can't go to her house. I'm 
            married and we can't go to my house. The Holiday Inn charges $90. 
            The Hilton charges $108. We do it here for $50, and I get $43 back 
            from Medicare.&quot;</p>

            <p>True Story... A female news anchor who, the 
            day after it was supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the 
            weatherman and asked, &quot;So Bob, where's that 6 inches you promised me 
            last night?&quot; Not only did he have to leave the set, but half the 
            crew did too... they were laughing so hard.</p>

            <p>A young doctor had moved into town and was 
            setting up a new practice. He had a new sign painted and hung it in 
            front of his office, proclaiming his specialties: &quot;Homosexuals &amp; 
            Hemorrhoids.&quot; The town fathers were upset with the sign and asked 
            him please to change it. The Doctor was eager to please, so he put 
            up a new sign: &quot;Queers &amp; Rears.&quot; The town fathers were really fuming 
            about that one, so they demanded that the Doctor come up with a 
            decent sign that would not offend the townspeople. So the Doctor 
            came up with an acceptable sign: &quot;Odds &amp; Ends.&quot;</p>

            <p>According to archaeologists, for millions of 
            years Neanderthal man was not fully erect. That's pretty easy to 
            understand considering how ugly Neanderthal woman were.</p>

            <p>A bride who got a little too drunk at her 
            wedding reception was still determined to say a few words of thanks 
            to the guests for all their presents. She stumbled through a short 
            speech and then slowly turned to point to the presents on display, 
            which included a coffee percolator &quot;And finally&quot; she said &quot;I do 
            thank my new parents-in-law for giving us such a beautiful perky 
            copulator&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A study in Scotland showed that the kind of 
            &quot;male face&quot; a woman finds attractive can differ depending on where a 
            woman is in her menstrual cycle. For instance, if she is 
            post-menstrual she may be attracted to plain facial features. When 
            pre-menstrual she can be attracted to more feminine features in a 
            man. If she is ovulating she is attracted to men with rugged, 
            masculine features, and if she is menstruating she is more prone to 
            be attracted to a man with a pair of scissors shoved in his temple.</p>

            <p>Grandma and Grandpa were watching a healing 
            service on the television. The evangelist called to all who wanted 
            to be healed to go to their television set, place one hand on the TV 
            and the other hand on the body part where they wanted to be healed. 
            Grandma got up and slowly hobbled to the television set, placed her 
            right hand on the set and her left hand on her arthritic shoulder 
            that was causing her to have great pain. Then Grandpa got up, went 
            to the TV, placed his right hand on the set and his left hand on his 
            crotch. Grandma scowled at him and said, &quot;I guess you just don't get 
            it. The purpose of doing this is to heal the sick, not raise the 
            dead.&quot;</p>

            <p>Husband: Ohhh, you are wonderfully tight 
            tonight darling!<br />
            Wife: Get that big hairy thing out of my navel!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Mr. Jones gets a call from the hospital. They 
            tell him his wife's been in a terrible car accident. He rushes to 
            the hospital, runs into the ER and says his wife's been in an 
            accident. They tell him Dr. Smith is handling the case. They page 
            the doctor. He comes out to the waiting room to see a terribly upset 
            Mr. Jones.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Mr. Jones?&quot; the doctor asks. &quot;Yes sir, what's happened? How is my 
            wife?&quot; The doctor sits next to him and says, &quot;Not good news. Your 
            wife's accident resulted in two fractures of her spine.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh my God&quot; says Mr. Jones, &quot;what will be her prognosis?&quot; Dr. Smith 
            says &quot;Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However, her 
            spine is inoperable. She'll have no motor skills or capability. This 
            means you will have to feed her.&quot; Mr. Jones begins to sob. &quot;And 
            you'll have to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent 
            pneumonia.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly. &quot;Then, of course,&quot; the 
            doctor continued, &quot;you'll have to diaper her as she'll have no 
            control over her bladder and of course these diapers must be changed 
            at least five times a day.&quot; Mr. Jones begins to shake as he cries, 
            sobs, wails.<br />
            <br />
            The doctor continues: &quot;And you'll have to clean up her feces on a 
            regular basis as she'll have no control over her sphincters. Her 
            bowel will engorge whenever and quite often I'm afraid. Of course 
            you must clean her immediately to avoid accumulation of the putrid 
            effluent she'll be emitting regularly.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Now Mr. Jones is convulsing sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to 
            wither off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass. Just then Dr. 
            Smith reaches out his hand and pats Mr. Jones on the shoulder. &quot;Hey, 
            I'm just fucking with you, she's dead.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>After just a few years of marriage, filled 
            with constant arguments, young man and his wife decided the only way 
            to save their marriage was to try counselling. They had been at each 
            other's throat for some time and felt that this was their last 
            straw. When they arrived at the counsellor's office, the counsellor 
            jumped right in and opened the floor for discussion.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;What seems to be the problem?&quot; Immediately, the husband held his 
            long face down without anything to say. On the other hand, the wife 
            began talking 100 miles an hour describing all the wrongs within 
            their marriage. After 5 then 10 then 15 minutes of listening to the 
            wife, the counsellor went over to her, picked her up by her 
            shoulders, kissed her passionately for several minutes, and sat her 
            back down. <br />
            <br />
            Afterwards, the wife sat there - speechless. He looked over at the 
            husband who was staring in disbelief at what had happened. The 
            counsellor spoke to the husband, &quot;Your wife NEEDS that at least 
            twice a week!&quot; The husband scratched his head and replied, &quot;I can 
            have her here on Tuesdays and Thursdays.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>At the cinema a man noticed a young woman 
            sitting all by herself. He was excited to see she had both hands 
            under her skirt and was fingering herself furiously. He moved to the 
            next seat to her and offered his help. She welcomed his help, and so 
            the man started fingering her like crazy. When he tired and withdrew 
            his hand, he was surprised to see<br />
            her go back to work on herself with both hands. Wasn't I good 
            enough?&quot; he asked sheepishly. &quot;Great,&quot; she said, &quot;but these crabs 
            are still itching!&quot;</p>
