            <p align="left">Annoyed by the professor of
            anatomy who liked to tell &quot;naughty&quot; stories during class,
            a group of female students decided that the next time he started to
            tell one, they would all rise and leave the room in protest. The
            professor, however, got wind of their scheme just before class the
            following day, so he bided his time. Then, halfway through the
            lecture, he began. &quot;They say there is quite a shortage of
            prostitutes in France.&quot; The girls looked at one another, arose
            and started for the door. &quot;Young ladies,&quot; said the
            professor with a broad smile, &quot;the next plane doesn't leave
            till tomorrow afternoon.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Business was good at the local
            whorehouse and the madam decided to partition one of larger rooms.
            After the work was complete the carpenter&nbsp;asked for payment but
            was put off. After several weeks he still hadn't been paid and he
            regularly threatened, &quot;Pay me or I'll rip out the
            partition.&quot; Finally the madam offered to pay him in trade.
            &quot;Take any girl in the house and have your pleasure with
            her.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I'll take you.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Me? I'm an old lady. Take one of those young, good looking
            chicks.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I want you.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            So he took her upstairs and removed all her clothes, laid her on her
            back and put one finger in her pussy and one finger in her butt.
            &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked. &quot;I told you before.
            Pay me or I'll rip out the partition.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A wife says to her friend, &quot;Our sex life
            stinks.&quot; Her friend says, &quot;Do you ever watch your
            husband's face when you're having sex?&quot; She says, &quot;Once,
            and I saw rage.&quot; Her friend says, &quot;Why would he be angry
            during sex?&quot; The wife says, &quot;Because he was looking
            through the window at us.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Jack and Jill were twins who
            couldn't find dates to the prom. So Jill asked Jack to go with her.
            Jack said, &quot;No, you're my sister, that's gross.&quot; Jill
            said, &quot;Come on. Promise me if you can't find another date,
            you'll take me.&quot; So Jack said okay. Well, Jack couldn't find a
            date so he went with Jill. They were just standing by the punch
            bowl, and Jill asked Jack to dance. Jack said, &quot;No, you're my
            sister, that's gross.&quot; Jill said, &quot;Come on. It'll be
            fun.&quot; So Jack said okay, and they had a great time. After the
            dance, Jill asked Jack to take her to Makeout Hill. Jack said,
            &quot;No, you're my sister, It would be gross.&quot; Jill said,
            &quot;We'll just talk, we don't talk anymore.&quot; So Jack said
            okay. They were at Makeout Hill talking, when Jill moved to the
            backseat. Jill said, &quot;Come on, Jack, take me.&quot; Jack didn't
            argue. When Jack moved on top of Jill, Jill murmured, &quot;You're a
            lot lighter than dad.&quot;<br />
            Jack said back, &quot;I know. Mom told me last night.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A couple drove down a country road, not saying
            a word. An earlier discussion had led to an argument, and neither
            would concede their position. As they passed a barnyard of mules and
            pigs, the wife sarcastically asked, &quot;Relatives of yours?&quot;
            &quot;Yep,&quot; the husband replied. &quot;In-laws.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Every night after dinner, Harry took off for
            the local watering hole. He would spend the whole evening there and
            always arrive home, well inebriated, around midnight each night. He
            usually had trouble getting his key to fit the keyhole and couldn't
            get the door open. And, every time this happened, his wife would go
            to the door and let him in. Then, she would proceed to yell and
            scream at him for his constant nights out and coming home in a
            drunken state. But, Harry still continued his nightly routine.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            One day, the distraught wife was talking to a friend about her
            husband's behavior. The friend listened and suggested, &quot;Why
            don't you treat him&nbsp;a little differently when he comes home?
            Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words
            and welcome him home with a kiss? Then, he might change his
            ways.&quot; The wife thought that this might be a good idea.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            That night, Harry took off again after dinner. And, at about
            midnight, he arrived home in his usual condition.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            His wife heard him at the door. She quickly opened it and let Harry
            in. Instead of berating him as she had always done, this time she
            took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat Harry down in
            an easy chair, put his feet up on the foot stool, and took his shoes
            off. Then, she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little.
            After a short while, she whispered to Harry, &quot;It's pretty late,
            dear. I think we should go upstairs to bed now, don't you
            think?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Harry replied in his inebriated state, &quot;Heck, I guess we might
            as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The Dean of Women at an exclusive girls'
            school was lecturing her students on sexual morality. &quot;We live
            today in very difficult times for young people. In moments of
            temptation,&quot; she said, &quot;ask yourself just one question: Is
            an hour of pleasure worth a lifetime of shame?&quot;&nbsp;A young
            woman rose in the back of the room and said, &quot;Excuse me, but
            how do you make it last an hour?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This guy visits the doctors and says,
            &quot;Doc, I think I've got a sex problem. I can't get it up for my
            wife anymore.&quot; The doctor says, &quot;Come back tomorrow and
            bring her with you.&quot; The next day, the guy shows up with his
            wife. The doctor says to the wife, &quot;Take off your clothes and
            lie on the table.&quot; She does it, and the doctor walks around the
            table a few times looking her up and down. He pulls the guy to the
            side and says, &quot;You're fine. She doesn't give me a hard-on,
            either.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man is at work one day when he notices that
            his co-worker is wearing an earring. This man knows his co-worker to
            be a somewhat conservative fellow, so naturally he's curious about
            the sudden change in fashion sense. The man walks up to his
            co-worker and says, &quot;I didn't know you were into
            earrings.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Don't make such a big deal, it's only an earring,&quot; he
            replies sheepishly.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well, I'm curious,&quot; begged the man, &quot;how long have
            you been wearing an earring?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Er, ever since my wife found it in our bed.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>These two guys had just gotten divorced and
            they swore they would never have anything to do with women again.
            They were best friends and they decided to move up to Alaska as far
            north as they could go and never look at a woman again. They got up
            there and went into a trader's store and told him, &quot;Give us
            enough supplies to last two men for one year.&quot; The trader got
            the gear together and on top of each one's supplies he laid a board
            with a hole in it with fur around the hole.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The guys asked &quot;What's that board for?&quot; The trader said,
            &quot;Well, where you're going there are no women and you might need
            this.&quot; They said, &quot;No way! We've sworn off women for
            life!&quot; The trader said, &quot;Well. take the boards with you,
            and if you don't use them I'll refund your money next year.
            &quot;Okay,&quot; they said and left. The next year this guy came
            into the trader's store and said &quot;Give me enough supplies to
            last one man for one year.&quot; The trader said &quot;Weren't you
            in here last year with a partner?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Yeah&quot; said the guy. &quot;Where is he?&quot; asked the
            trader. &quot;I killed him&quot; said the guy. Shocked, the trader
            asks &quot;Why?&quot; To which the guy replies, &quot;I caught him
            in bed with my board!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man was complaining to a friend, &quot;I had
            it all - money, a magnificent house, a fast car, the love of a
            beautiful woman... then, poof! It was all gone!&quot; &quot;What
            happened?&quot; asked the friend. &quot;My wife found out...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Little Johnny walked into his dad's bedroom
            one day only catch him sitting on the side of his bed sliding on a
            condom. Johnny's father, in attempt to hide his full erection with a
            condom on it, bent over as if to look under the bed. Little Johnny
            asked curiously &quot;What ya doin dad?&quot; His father quickly
            replied, &quot;I thought I saw a rat go underneath the bed, to which
            Little Johnny replied &quot;What ya gonna do, fuck him?&quot;</p>

            <p>A guy was on his first date with a notoriously
            loose girl. She was immediately receptive to his foreplay after they
            parked. The petting went on and he put his hand in her panties. She
            seemed to be enjoying it, but suddenly objected, &quot;Ouch! That
            ring is hurting me!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;That's no ring... That's my watch!&quot;</p>

            <p>Two soldiers were having a chat during their
            free time.&nbsp; First Soldier: Why did you join the army? Second
            Soldier: I didn't have a wife and I loved war. So I joined. How
            about you? Why did you join the army? First Soldier: I had a wife
            and I loved peace. So I joined.</p>

            <p>Three old guys are sitting around complaining.
            The first guy says, &quot;My hands shake so bad that when I shaved
            this morning I almost cut my ear off.&quot; The second guy says,
            &quot;My hands shake so bad that when I ate breakfast today, I
            spilled half my coffee on my toast.&quot; The third guy says,
            &quot;My hands shake so bad that the last time I went to pee I came
            taking my cock out.&quot;</p>
