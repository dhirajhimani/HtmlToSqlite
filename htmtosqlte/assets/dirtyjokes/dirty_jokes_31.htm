         <p>George and Harriet decided to celebrate their 
         25th Wedding Anniversary with a trip to Las Vegas. When they entered 
         the hotel/casino and registered, a sweet young woman dressed in a very 
         short skirt became very friendly. George brushed her off. Harriet 
         objected, &quot;George, that young woman was nice, and you were so rude.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Harriet, she's a prostitute.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;I don't believe you. That sweet young thing?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Let's go up to our room and I'll prove it.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         In their room, George called down to the desk and asked for 'Bambi' to 
         come to room 1217. &quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;you hide in the bathroom with the 
         door open just enough to hear us, OK?&quot; Soon, there was a knock on the 
         door. George opened it and Bambi walked in, swirling her hips 
         provocatively. George asked, &quot;How much do you charge?&quot; &quot;$125 basic 
         rate, $100 tips for special services.&quot; Even George was taken aback. 
         &quot;$125! I was thinking more in the range of $25.&quot; Bambi laughed 
         derisively. &quot;You must really be a hick if you think you can buy sex for 
         that price.&quot;</p>
         <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said George, &quot;I guess we can't do 
         business. Goodbye.&quot; After she left, Harriet came out of the bathroom. 
         She said, &quot;I just can't believe it!&quot; George said, &quot;Let's forget it. 
         We'll go have a drink, then eat<br />
         dinner.&quot; At the bar, as they sipped their cocktails, Bambi came up 
         behind George, pointed slyly at Harriet, and said, &quot;See what you get 
         for $25?&quot;</p>

            <p>A businessman and his secretary, overcome by 
         passion, retire to his house for what is popularly termed a &quot;nooner.&quot; 
         &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he purrs. &quot;My wife is out of town on a business trip, 
         there's no risk.&quot; As one thing leads to another, the woman reaches into 
         her purse and suddenly gasps, &quot;We have to stop, I forgot to bring birth 
         control!&quot; &quot;No problem,&quot; her lover replies. &quot;I'll get my wife's 
         diaphragm.&quot; After a few minutes of searching, he returns to the bedroom 
         in a fury. &quot;That witch!&quot; he exclaims. &quot;She took it with her! I always 
         knew she didn't trust me!&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>Two drunks are standing at a whorehouse door. The 
         first drunk says, &quot;I heard half these broads have the clap and that 
         none of them would think twice about stealing every penny we've got.&quot; 
         The second drunk says, &quot;Not so loud, or they won't let us in.&quot;</p>

         <p>The mortician calls Mrs. Banley, and says, 
         &quot;Excuse me Mrs. Banley, but I can't seem to close the lid to your 
         husband's coffin because he has a huge erection.&quot; To which she replies, 
         &quot;Why don't you cut it off and stick it up his ass? That's the only hole 
         in town it hasn't been in.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy goes into a bar and says to the bartender, 
         &quot;Man, I'm dying to have sex in the worst way. So the bartender says, 
         &quot;Well, the worst way I know of is standing up in a hammock.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
         <p>I've never gone to bed with an ugly man, but I've 
         woken up with a few.</p>
            <hr />
         <p>A Mom is driving a little girl to her friends 
         house for a play date. &quot;Mommy,&quot; the little girl asks, &quot;how old are 
         you?&quot; The mother looks over at the little girl, &quot;Honey, you are not 
         supposed to ask a lady her age, it isn't polite.&quot; the mother warns. 
         &quot;Ok,&quot; the little girl says, &quot;How much do you weigh?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Now really,&quot; the mother says, &quot;these are personal questions and are 
         really none of your business.&quot; Undaunted, the little girl asks, &quot;Why 
         did you and daddy get a divorce?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;That is enough questions, honestly!&quot; The exasperated mother walks away 
         as the two friends begin to play.</p>
         <p>&quot;My Mom wouldn't tell me anything,&quot; the little 
         girl says to her friend. &quot;Well,&quot; said the friend, &quot;all you need to do 
         is look at her driver's license. It is like a report card, it has 
         everything on it.&quot; Later that night the little girl says to her mother, 
         &quot;I know how old you are, you are 32.&quot; The mother is surprised and asks, 
         &quot;How did you find that out?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;I also know that you weigh 140 pounds.&quot; The mother is past surprise 
         and shock now. &quot;How in heavens name did you find that out?&quot; The little 
         girl continues on triumphantly, &quot;And... I know why you and daddy got 
         divorce.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Oh really?&quot;, the mother asks, &quot;Why is that?&quot; To which the girl 
         replies, &quot;Because you got an F in sex.&quot;</p>

            <p>A couple is lying in bed. The man says, &quot;I am

            <p>A trucker goes into a whorehouse and hands the 
         Madam five hundred dollars. He says, &quot;I want your ugliest woman and a 
         bologna sandwich.&quot; The Madam says, &quot;For that kind of money, you could 
         have one of my finest girls and surf and turf.&quot; The trucker says, &quot;I 
         ain't horny, I'm homesick.&quot;</p>

         <p>Jack is on his death bed, and he says to his 
         wife, &quot;Can you give me one last wish?&quot; She says, &quot;Anything you want.&quot; 
         He says, &quot;After I die, will you marry Larry?&quot; She says, &quot;But I thought 
         you hated Larry.&quot; With his last breath, he says, &quot;I do.&quot;</p>

         <p>Three guys are fishing when Fred gets up to get a 
         beer, loses his balance and falls out of the boat. Ed says &quot; What 
         should we do?&quot; Bill says, &quot;You better jump in after him, he's been 
         under water for a while, he might need some help.&quot; So Ed jumps in, and 
         after some time, he surfaces. He says, &quot;Help me get him in the boat.&quot; 
         They wrestle Fred back into the boat. Ed says, &quot;What do we do now, it 
         doesn't look like he's breathing.&quot; Bill says, &quot;Give him mouth to 
         mouth.&quot; Ed starts to blow air into Fred's mouth and says, &quot;Whoa, I 
         don't remember Fred having such bad breath.&quot; Bill says, &quot;Come to think 
         of it, I don't think Fred was wearing a snowmobile suit, either.&quot;</p>

         <p>Patient: &quot;Doc, you gotta help me. I'm under a 
         lot of stress. I keep losing my temper with people.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         Doctor: &quot;Tell me about your problem.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         Patient: &quot;I just did, you fucking jackass!&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>The guy says, &quot;Doc, I'm having trouble getting it 
         up.&quot; The doctor examines him and says, &quot;You'll need to have some work 
         done to bring back your sex drive. I can do it in a series of 
         operations that will take thirty days and cost twelve thousand dollars, 
         or I can do it in one operation right away that would cost thirty 
         thousand dollars. Why don't you go home and discuss it with your wife?&quot; 
         The next day the guy comes back into the doctor's office. The doctor 
         says, &quot;What did you decide?&quot; He says, &quot;We're going to re-do the 
         kitchen.&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>Mr. Geraldo says to his doctor, &quot;Doc, I had the 
         worst dream of my life last night. I dreamed I was with twelve of the 
         most beautiful chorus girls in the world. Blondes, brunettes, redheads, 
         and they were all dancing in a row.&quot; The psychiatrist says, &quot;Now hold 
         on, Mr. Geraldo. That doesn't sound so terrible.&quot; Mr. Geraldo says, 
         &quot;Oh, yeah? I was the third girl from the end.&quot;</p>

            <p>A flat-chested young lady went to Dr. Smith for 
         advice about breast enlargements. He told her, &quot;Every day when you get 
         out of the shower, rub the top of your nipples and say, 'Scooby dooby 
         dooby, I want bigger boobies.' &quot; She did this every day faithfully. 
         After several months, it worked! She grew great boobs! One morning she 
         was running late, and in her rush to leave for work, she realized she 
         had forgotten her morning ritual. At this point she loved her boobs and 
         didn't want to lose them, so she got up in the middle of the bus and 
         said, &quot;Scooby dooby<br />
         dooby, I want bigger boobies.&quot; A guy sitting nearby asked her, &quot;Do you 
         go to Dr. Smith by any chance?&quot; &quot;Why yes, I do. How did you know?&quot; The 
         man stood up and cupped his balls and said, &quot;Hickory dickory dock...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This fellow comes into a pharmacy and asks for a 
         vial of Cyanide. The pharmacist, trying to keep a professional posture, 
         asked what he wanted it for. He answered, &quot;I want to kill my wife.&quot; 
         &quot;I'm sorry Sir,&quot; the pharmacist replied, &quot;but you will have to 
         understand under such circumstances I can't sell you any Cyanide.&quot; The 
         guy reaches into his wallet and produces a photo of his wife. The 
         pharmacist looks at the photo of the ugliest woman he has ever seen, 
         blushes and replies, &quot;I am sorry Sir, let me get it for you... I didn't 
         realize you had a prescription.&quot;</p>
