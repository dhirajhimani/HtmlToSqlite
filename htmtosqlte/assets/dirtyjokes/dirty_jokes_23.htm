            <p>A 16-year-old girl finally had the opportunity
            to go to a party by herself. Since she was very good-looking, she
            was a bit nervous about what to do if boys hit on her. Her mom said,
            &quot;It's very easy! Whenever a boy starts hitting on you, you ask
            him, 'What will be the name of our baby?' That'll scare them
            off.&quot; So off she went. After a little while at the party, a boy
            started dancing with her, and little by little he started kissing
            her and touching her. She asked him, &quot;What will our baby be
            called?&quot; The boy found some excuse and disappeared. Some time
            later, the same thing happened again: a boy started to kiss her
            neck, her shoulders... She stopped him and asked about the baby's
            name, and he ran off.<br />
            <br />
            Later on, another boy invited her for a walk. After a few minutes,
            he started kissing her, and she asked him, &quot;What will our baby
            be called?&quot; He continued, now slowly taking her clothes off.
            &quot;What will our baby be called?&quot; she asked once more. He
            began to have sex with her. &quot;What will our baby be
            called?!&quot; she asked again. After he was done, he took off his
            &quot;full&quot; condom, gave it a knot, and said, &quot;If he gets
            out of this one... David Copperfield!</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">In the days before birth control
            pills, a young bride-to-be asked her gynecologist to recommend some
            sort of contraceptive. He suggested she try withdraw, douches or
            condoms. Several years later, the woman was walking down the street
            with three children when she happened to run across her old doctor.
            &quot;I see you decided not to take my advice,&quot; he said, eyeing
            the young children. &quot;On the contrary, doc,&quot; she exclaimed,
            &quot;Davey here was a pullout, Darcy was a washout, and Delores was
            a blowout!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Two women walked into a
            department store, stopped at the perfume counter and picked up a
            sample bottle. One sprayed the perfume on her wrist and smelled it.
            &quot;That's nice, isn't it?&quot; Sharon said waving her arm under
            her friend's nose. &quot;Yeah. What's it called?&quot; &quot;Viens a
            moi.&quot; &quot;Viens a moi? What's that mean?&quot; A clerk
            offered some help. &quot;Viens a moi, ladies, is French for 'come to
            me.'&quot; Sharon took another sniff. &quot;That doesn't smell like
            come to me,&quot; she said, offering her arm to her friend again.
            &quot;Does that smell like come to you?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Whilst enjoying a drink with a buddy one
            night, this guy decides to try his luck with an attractive young
            girl sitting alone by the bar. To his surprise, she asks him to join
            her for a drink and eventually asks him if he'd like to come back to
            her place. The pair jump into a taxi and go back to her place.<br />
            <br />
            Later, the young man pulls out a cigarette from his jeans and
            searches for his lighter. Unable to find it, he asks the girl if she
            has one at hand. &quot;There might be some matches in the top
            drawer,&quot; she replies. Opening the drawer of the bedside table,
            he finds a box of matches sitting neatly on top of a framed picture
            of another man. Naturally, the guy begins to worry.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Is this your husband?&quot; he inquires nervously. &quot;No,
            silly,&quot; she replies, snuggling up to him. &quot;Your boyfriend
            then?&quot; &quot;No, don't be silly,&quot; she says, nibbling away
            at his ear. &quot;Well, who is he then?&quot; demands the bewildered
            fellow. Calmly, the girl takes a match, strikes it across the side
            of her face and replies, &quot;That's me before the operation.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A large, powerfully-built guy named Raymond
            meets a woman named Polly at a bar. After a number of drinks, they
            agree to go back to his place. As they are making out in the
            bedroom, Raymond stands up and starts to undress. After he takes his
            shirt off, Raymond flexes his muscular arms and says, &quot;See
            that, baby? That's 1000 pounds of dynamite!&quot; Polly begins to
            drool. Raymond then drops his pants, strikes a bodybuilder's pose,
            and says, referring to his bulging thighs, &quot;See those, baby?
            That's 1000 pounds of dynamite!&quot; Polly is just aching for
            action at this point. Finally, Raymond drops his underpants, and
            after a quick glance, Polly grabs her purse and runs screaming to
            the front door. Raymond catches her before she is able to leave and
            asks, &quot;Why are you in such a hurry to go?&quot; Polly then
            replies, &quot;With 2000 pounds of dynamite and such a short fuse, I
            was afraid you were about to blow!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Morris wakes up in the morning. He has a
            massive hangover and can't remember anything he did last night. He
            picks up his bath robe from the floor and puts it on. He notices
            there's something in one of the pockets and it turns out to be a
            bra. He thinks &quot;bloody hell what happened last night??&quot;.
            He walks towards the bathroom and finds a panty in the other pocket
            of his robe. Again he thinks &quot;what happened last night, what
            have I done? Must have been a wild party&quot;. He opens the
            bathroom door, walks in and has a look in the mirror. He notices a
            little string hanging out of his mouth and his only thought is
            &quot;Please, if there's a God, please let this be a teabag.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman found out that her husband was
            cheating on her while stationed in Saudi a few months ago. So she
            sends him this care package. He is excited to get a package from his
            wife back home. He finds that it contains a batch of home made
            cookies and a VHS tape of his favorite TV shows. He invites a couple
            of his buddies over and they're all sitting around having a great
            time eating the cookies and watching some episodes of South Park.<br />
            <br />
            Right in the middle of one episode the tape cuts to a home video of
            his wife on her knees sucking his best friend's ding dong. After a
            few seconds, he blows his load in her pie hole and she turns and
            spits the load right into the mixing bowl of cookie dough. She then
            looks at the camera and says, &quot;By the way, I want a
            divorce.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young woman was having a physical
            examination and was embarrassed because of a weight problem. As she
            removed her last bit of clothing, she blushed. &quot;I'm so ashamed,
            Doctor,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess I let myself go.&quot; The
            physician was checking hers eyes and ears. &quot;Don't feel ashamed,
            Miss. You don't look that bad.&quot; &quot;Do you really think so,
            Doctor?&quot; she asked. The doctor held a tongue depressor in front
            of her face and said, &quot;Of course. Now just open your mouth and
            say moo.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>These two poor kids go to a birthday party at
            a rich kid's house. The kid is so rich that he has his own swimming
            pool and all the kids go in. As they're changing afterwards, one of
            the poor kids says to the other one, &quot;Did you notice how small
            the rich kid's penises were?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; says his mate,
            &quot;It's probably because they've got toys to play with.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>These three lads are drinking in a pub when
            this bloke comes in and starts drinking at the bar. After a while
            the bloke goes up to the group of lads, points at the one in the
            middle and says, in a drunken slur, &quot;I've shagged your
            Mum.&quot; The three lads look bewildered and the bloke goes back to
            drinking at the bar. Ten minutes later he comes back and announces,
            &quot;Your Mum has sucked my penis.&quot; The three lads try and
            ignore him and he goes back to the bar. After another ten minutes he
            comes back and shouts, &quot;I've had your Mum up the arse.&quot; By
            now the lads have had enough and the one in the middle stands up and
            says, &quot;Look, Dad, you're pissed. Now fuck off home.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Police officers George and Mary, had been
            assigned to walk the beat. They had only been out a short while when
            Mary said, &quot;Damn, I was running late this morning after my
            workout and after I showered, I forgot to put on my panties! We have
            to go back to the station to get them.&quot; George replied,
            &quot;We don't have to go back, just give the K-9 unit, Fido, one
            sniff, and he will go fetch them for you.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            It was a hot day and Mary didn't fell like heading back to the
            station, so she lifted her skirt for the dog. Fido's nose shoots
            between her legs, sniffing and snorting. After 10 seconds of
            sniffing, Fido's ears pick up, he sniffs the wind, and he is off in
            a flash towards the station house. Five minutes go by and no sign of
            Fido. Ten minutes pass, and the dog is nowhere to be seen. Fifteen
            minutes pass, and they are starting to worry.<br />
            <br />
            Twenty minutes pass, and they hear sirens in the distance. The
            sirens get louder and louder. Suddenly, followed by a dozen police
            cars, Fido rounds the corner with the Desk Sergeant's balls in his
            mouth.</p>

            <p>Two brothers have a lifelong dream to
            immigrate to America. They work hard and save their money. After
            many years, they have saved enough money and finally emigrate into
            New York. Before they begin building their new lives in America,
            they decide to see some of the famous places they dreamed of for so
            long; the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, the
            Rockettes, and others. Eventually, they make their way to Coney
            Island. As they stroll down the beach, taking in all the newness of
            America, they see a very large billboard that reads: &quot;HOT
            DOGS,&quot; with a big arrow pointing down to a little hot dog
            stand. Being hungry and seeing that having an American hot dog would
            be something new, they decide to try one. So they order two hot dogs
            and sit on a nearby bench to enjoy another piece of Americana. The
            first brother sets his hot dog in his lap, unfolds the paper
            wrapper, looks at his hot dog for a moment, and suddenly wraps it
            back up. He then turns to his brother and says, &quot;What part of
            the dog did you get?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Seems this elderly couple went to the clinic
            and asked to be tested for HIV. When the counselor asked why they
            felt that they should be tested at their age, the old man said,
            &quot;Well, we heard on TV that people should be tested after annual
            sex!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy goes to pick up his date for the
            evening. She's not ready yet, so he has to sit in the living room
            with her parents. He has a BAD case of gas and really needs to
            relieve some pressure. Then, the family dog jumps up on the couch
            next to him. He decides that he can let a little fart out and if
            anyone notices they will think that the dog did it. He farts, and
            the woman yells, &quot;Spot, get down from there.&quot; The guy
            thinks, &quot;Great, they think the dog did it.&quot; He releases
            another fart, and the woman again yells for the dog to get down.
            This goes on for a couple more farts. Finally the woman yells,
            &quot;Dammit Spot, get down before he shits on you.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Bill pilled up a stool at his favorite bar and
            announced, &quot;My wife Suzie must love me more than any woman has
            ever loved any man!&quot; &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; the
            bartender inquired.&nbsp; &quot;Last week,&quot; Bill explained,
            &quot;I had to take a couple of sick days from work. Suzie was so
            thrilled to have me around that every time the milkman and the post
            office guy came by, she'd run down the driveway, waving her arms and
            hollering, `My old man's home! My old man's home!'&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A tourist arrived in Australia, hired a car
            and set off for the outback. On his way he saw a bloke having sex
            with a sheep. Deeply horrified, he pulled up at the nearest pub and
            ordered a straight Scotch. Just as he was about to throw it back, he
            saw a bloke with one leg masturbating furiously at the bar.
            &quot;For fuck's sake!&quot; the bloke cried, &quot;what the hell's
            going on here? I've been here one hour and I've seen a bloke
            shagging a sheep, and now some bloke's wanking himself off in the
            bar!&quot; &quot;Fair dinkum, mate,&quot; the bartender told him,
            &quot;you can't expect a man with only one leg to catch a
            sheep&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Old Mendel Rugelbaum was very old and
            suffering from a rare disease and could drink only human milk.
            &quot;How can I get human milk?&quot; Mendel asked the doctor.
            &quot;Well, Ruby Finkelstein's just had a baby, maybe she'll
            help.&quot; So every day Mendel went to Ruby's house for his daily
            feed. Ruby was a dark-eyed, big breasted lady, who, in spite of
            herself, gradually became aroused as Mendel lapped at her ripe
            breasts. One day as he quietly lay sucking, she whispered to him,
            &quot; Tell me Mr. Rugelbaum, do you like it?&quot; &quot;Mmmm,
            wonderful,&quot; he sighed. &quot;is there....,&quot; she hesitated,
            her lips parted, eyes aglow, &quot;is there anything else you'd
            like?&quot; &quot;As a matter of fact there is,&quot; murmured
            Mendel. &quot;What?&quot; Ruby asked breathlessly. Mendel licked his
            lips. &quot;Maybe a little biscuit?&quot;</p>
