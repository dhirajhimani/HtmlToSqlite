            <p>A man tells his wife that he's going out to
            buy cigarettes. When he gets to the store he finds out it's closed.
            So the guy ends up going to the bar to use the vending machine.
            While there, he has a few beers and begins talking to this beautiful
            girl. He has a few more beer and the next thing he knows he's in
            this girl's apartment and having quite a pleasurable time. The next
            thing he know it was 3:00 AM.</p>
            <p>&quot;Oh my, god, my wife is going to kill
            me!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Quick give me some talcum
            powder!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            She gets him some and he rubs it all over his hands. When he got
            home his wife is up waiting for him and she's furious. &quot;Where
            the hell have you been!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            He says, &quot;Well to tell you the truth, I went into a bar, had a
            few drinks, went home with this blonde and I slept with her.&quot;
            &quot;Let me see your hands!&quot; she demands. He shows his wife
            his powdery hands.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Damn liar, you were out bowling again!&quot;</p>

            <p>A Guy is driving his girlfriend home when she
            decides she wants to go to her friends instead. Her friend lives out
            of the way so she tells her boyfriend that she would get naked for
            him if he drove her. The guy says ok and the girl takes off all her
            clothes. The boyfriend is so busy looking at her that he stacks the
            car and gets stuck between the steering wheel and the seat. He tells
            her to go get help and she replied that she couldn't because she
            didn't have any clothes on. He replies, &quot;Take my shoe and cover
            your snatch with it, and go for help!&quot;</p>
            <p>She takes the shoe and runs to the closest gas
            station. She finds the clerk and says, &quot;Help, my boyfriend is
            stuck! Can you help us?&quot; The clerk replies, &quot;I'm sorry,
            I think he's too far in.&quot;</p>

            <p>A husband comes home to find his wife with her
            suitcases packed in the living room. &quot;Where the hell do you
            think you're going?&quot; he says. &quot;I'm going to Las Vegas. You
            can earn $400 for a blow job there, and I figured that I might as
            well earn money for what I do to you free.&quot;</p>
            <p>The husband thinks for a moment, goes
            upstairs, and comes back down, with his suitcase packed as well.
            &quot;Where do you think you going?&quot; the wife asks. &quot;I'm
            coming with you...I want to see how you survive on $800 a

            <p>Clinton dies and of course goes straight to
            hell. When he gets there the Devil greets him and offers him three
            ways to spend eternity. They go to the first door and the Devil
            shows him Newt Gingrich, hanging from the ceiling with fire under
            him. Bill says &quot;Oh no! That's not how I want to spend all
            eternity.......&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; They go to the second door. The
            Devil shows him Rush Limbaugh chained to the wall being tortured.
            Bill says &quot;Oh no! Not for me!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            They go to the third door. Behind it is Ken Starr, chained to the
            wall with Monica Lewinsky on her knees giving him a blowjob. Bill
            thinks and decides, &quot;Hmmm, looks okay to me. I'll take
            it.&quot; The Devil then says, &quot;Good. Hey Monica, you've been

            <p>A young boy and his father were in a store
            when they walked past a rack of condoms. Being a curious young lad,
            the boy asked his father, &quot;What are these things daddy?&quot;
            His dad said, &quot;Condoms son.&quot; The boy asked, &quot;Why do
            they come in packs of 1,3, and 12?&quot; The dad replied, &quot;The
            packs with one are for the high school boys, one for Saturday night,
            the ones with three are for the college boys, one for Friday,
            Saturday and Sunday, and the ones with twelve in them are for the
            married men, one for January, one for February, one for

            <p>A dwarf gets on an elevator and pushes the
            button to go up, just before the door closes, a hand comes through
            and opens the door. In steps a very large black man. The dwarf
            stares and says &quot;You're the biggest man I have ever
            seen&quot;. The man nods his head, and replies &quot;I'm 6-9,
            weigh 259 lbs., and I have 16 inches, I'm Turner Brown.&quot; The dwarf
            faints! After coming too, the dwarf asks the man to repeat
            himself.&nbsp; So he does, &quot;I said I'm 6 - 9, 259 lbs., with
            16 inches, my name is Turner Brown.&quot; The dwarf looked relieved and
            started laughing. &quot;For a minute there, I thought you said 'Turn

            <p>The Seven Most Important Men in a Woman's Life<br />
            <br />

            clothes.&quot;<br />

            the back?&quot;<br />
            <br />

            soon, you'll lose interest!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            7. The Primal Hunter - who always goes deep into the bush, always

            <hr color="#000000" size="1">
            <p>A guy is driving out in the middle of nowhere,
            very lost. Finally he spots 2 houses so he goes up to the first
            house and looks in the door way. He sees an old lady yanking on her
            boobs and an old man jerking off. He is so freaked out that he goes
            to the next house and says &quot;What's up with your
            neighbors?&quot; and the owner of the house says &quot;Oh that's
            the Robinson's, they're both deaf. She's telling him to go milk
            the cow and he's telling her to go fuck herself!&quot;</p>
            <hr color="#000000" size="1">
            <p>One day a girl decided to buy some crotchless
            panties to surprise her boyfriend. She went and bought them, got
            home, put them on and waited. When the boyfriend got home there she
            was spread eagle on the bed with only her panties and bra on.
            &quot;Come over here baby.&quot; she says smiling. The boyfriend
            backs off, &quot;If your pussy can do that to your panties - I ain't
            going any where near it!&quot;</p>
            <hr color="#000000" size="1">
            <p>One day this girl was talking to her friend
            and she said to her, &quot;My boyfriend bought me flowers for
            Valentines day this year so I guess I have to put my legs in the air
            for him.&quot;, and her friend replied, &quot;Why? Don't you have a
            vase?&quot;</p>

            <p>Do you know what Rodeo Sex is?</p>
            <p>It's when you mount your woman from behind,
            start going nice and slowly, take her hair and pull her head back
            slightly and whisper in her ear &quot;Your sister was better than
            you...&quot;, and try to hold on for 8 seconds!</p>
            <hr color="#000000" size="1">
            <p>As a painless way to save money, a young
            couple arranged that every time they have sex the husband puts his
            pocket change into a china piggy bank on the bedside table. One
            night while being unusually athletic, he accidentally knocked the
            piggy bank onto the floor where it smashes.</p>
            <p>To his surprise, among the masses of coins,
            there are handfuls of five and ten dollar bills. He asks his wife
            &quot;What's up with all the notes?&quot;, to his wife which
            replies, &quot;Well, not everyone is as cheap as you are.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young husband and wife were sunning on a
            nude beach when a wasp buzzed into the woman's vagina. The husband
            covered her with a coat, pulled on his shorts, carried her to the
            car and made a dash to the hospital.<br />
            <br />
            After examining her, the doctor explained that the wasp was too far
            in to be reached with forceps. He suggested the husband try to
            entice it out by putting honey on his penis, penetrating her and
            withdrawing as soon as he felt the wasp.<br />
            <br />
            The man agreed to try, but because he was so nervous, he couldn't
            rise to the occasion. &quot;if neither of you objects,&quot; the
            medic said, &quot;I could give it a try.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Under the circumstances, both agreed. The doctor quickly undressed,
            slathered on some honey and mounted the woman. The husband watched
            with increasing alarm as the doctor's thrust continued for several
            long minutes. &quot;Hey, What the hell is happening?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Change of plans,&quot; The physician panted. &quot; I'm going
            to drown the little bastard!.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy comes home from work, walks into his
            bedroom, and finds a stranger fucking his wife. He says, &quot;What
            the hell are you two doing?&quot; His wife turns to the stranger and
            says, &quot;I told you he was stupid.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Gary and Mary go on their honeymoon, and Gary
            spends six hours of the honeymoon night eating Mary's pussy. The
            next afternoon, they go to an Italian restaurant. Suddenly, Gary
            starts to freak out. He screams, &quot;Waiter! Waiter! Come over
            here!&quot;<br />
            The waiter says, &quot;Can I help you, sir?&quot; Gary yells,
            &quot;There's a hair in my spaghetti! Get it the fuck out of
            here!&quot; The waiter apologizes up and down as he quickly takes
            the spaghetti away. Mary looks over at Gary, and shaking her head,
            she whispers, &quot;What a hypocrite you are. You spent most of last
            night with your face full of hair.&quot; Gary says, &quot;Yeah?
            Well, how long do you think I'd have stayed if I found a piece of
            spaghetti in there?&quot;</p>
