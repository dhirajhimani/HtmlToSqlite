            <p>A teenager is walking downtown and a girl
            whispers to him, &quot;Blowjob, five dollars&quot;. He gives her a
            strange look and keeps walking. Soon another girl does the same
            thing. Confused, he keeps walking. The first thing out of his mouth
            when he returned home was &quot;Mom, what's a blowjob?&quot;. His
            mom replies &quot;Five dollars, just like downtown!&quot;.</p>

            <p>A woman walks into the store and purchases the
            following: 1 small box of detergent<br />
            1 Bar of soap<br />
            3 individual servings of yogurt<br />
            2 oranges<br />
            1 stick of womenï¿½s deodorant.<br />
            She then goes to the check out line.<br />
            <br />
            Cashier: Oh, you must be single<br />
            Woman: You can tell that by what I bought?<br />
            Cashier: No, you're fucking ugly!</p>

            <p>A blind man was walking down the street with
            his dog. They stopped at the corner to wait for the passing traffic.
            The dog, at this point, started pissing on the mans leg. As the dog
            finished the man reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a
            doggie treat and started waving it at the dog. A passerby saw all
            the events happening and was shocked. He approached the blind man
            and asked how he could possibly reward the dog for such a nasty
            deed. The blind man replied &quot;Oh I'm not rewarding him, I'm just
            trying to find his head so I can kick his fuckin' ass.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two men waiting at the pearly gates strike up
            a conversation. &quot;How'd you die?&quot; the first man asks the
            second. &quot;I froze to death,&quot; says the second. &quot;That's
            awful, how does it feel to freeze to death?&quot; says the first.
            &quot;It's very uncomfortable at first, you get the shakes, and you
            get pains in all your fingers and toes. But eventually, it's a very
            calm way to go. You get numb and you kind of drift off, as if you're
            sleeping. How did you die?&quot; says the second. &quot;I had a
            heart attack&quot;, says the first guy. &quot;You see, I knew my
            wife was cheating on me, so one day I showed up at home
            unexpectedly. I ran up to the bedroom, and found her alone,
            knitting. I ran down to the basement, bot no one was hiding there. I
            ran up to the second floor, but no one was hiding there either. I
            ran as fast as I could to the attic, and just as I got there, I had
            a massive heart attack and died.&quot; The second man shakes his
            head. &quot;that's so ironic&quot; he says. &quot;What do you
            mean?&quot; asks the first man &quot;If you had only stopped to look
            in the freezer, we'd both still be alive.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man walks into a bar and asks the bartender
            for a case of beer, any kind except Schlitz. The bartender says,
            &quot;What's wrong with Schlitz, don't you like it? The man says,
            &quot;I hate that shit&quot;. Last night I drank a whole case of
            Schlitz and blew chunks. The bartender says, &quot;You drink a case
            of any beer you're going to blow chunks&quot;. You don't understand
            said the man, Chunks is my dog.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Roger is a hard worker, and he spends most of
            his nights bowling or playing volleyball. One weekend, his wife
            decides that he needs to relax a little and take a break from
            sports, so she takes him to a strip club. The doorman at the club
            spots them and says &quot;Hey Roger! How are you tonight?&quot; His
            wife, surprised, asks her husband if he has been here before.
            &quot;No, no. He's just one of the guys I bowl with.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            They are seated, and the waitress approaches, sees Roger and says
            &quot;Nice to see you, Roger. A gin and tonic as usual?&quot; His
            wife's eyes widen. &quot;You must come here a lot!&quot; &quot;No,
            no&quot; says Roger &quot;I just know her from volleyball.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Then a stripper walks up to the table. She throws her arms around
            Roger and says &quot;Roger! A table dance as usual?&quot; His wife,
            fuming, collects her things and storms out of the bar. Roger follows
            her and spots her getting into a cab, so he jumps into the passenger
            seat. His wife looks at him, seething with fury and lets Roger have
            it with both barrels.<br />
            <br />
            At this, the cabby leans over and says &quot;Sure looks like you
            picked up a bitch tonight, Roger!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Three nuns were talking. The first nun said,
            &quot;I was cleaning in Father's room the other day and do you know
            what I found? A bunch of pornographic magazines.&quot; &quot;What
            did you do?&quot; the other nuns asked. &quot;Well, of course I
            threw them in the trash.&quot; The second nun said, &quot;Well, I
            can top that. I was in Father's room putting away the laundry and I
            found a bunch of condoms!&quot; &quot;Oh my!&quot; gasped the other
            nuns. &quot;What did you do?&quot; they asked. &quot;I poked holes
            in all of them!&quot; she replied. The third nun fainted.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>As an ultimate test of his will power, a man
            decided to give up sex for Lent. Although not thrilled with the
            idea, his wife agreed to support him in this effort. The first few
            weeks weren't too difficult. Things got tougher during the next
            couple of weeks, so the wife wore her dowdiest nightclothes and
            chewed on garlic before going to bed. The last couple of weeks were
            extremely tough on the husband, so the wife took to locking the
            bedroom door and forcing the husband to sleep on the couch.<br />
            <br />
            Easter morning finally came. A knock came on the wife's bedroom
            door.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;KNOCK!!! KNOCK!!! KNOCK!!!&quot;<br />
            Husband: &quot;Guess whom?&quot;<br />
            Wife: &quot;I know who it is!&quot;<br />
            Husband: &quot;Guess what I want?&quot;<br />
            Wife: &quot;I know what you want!&quot;<br />
            Husband: &quot;Guess what I'm knockin' with?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy has been asking the prettiest girl in
            town for a date and finally she agrees to go out with him. He takes
            her to a nice restaurant and buys her a fancy dinner with expensive
            wine. On the way home, he pulls over to the side of the road in a
            secluded spot. They start necking and he's getting pretty excited.
            He starts to reach under her skirt and she stops him, saying she's a
            virgin and wants to stay that way.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well, okay,&quot; he says, &quot;how about a blow job?&quot;
            &quot;Yuck!&quot; she screams. &quot;I'm not putting that thing in
            my mouth!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            He says, &quot;Well, then, how about a hand job?&quot; &quot;I've
            never done that,&quot; she says. &quot;What do I have to do?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well,&quot; he answers, &quot;remember when you were a kid and
            you used to shake up a Coke bottle and spray your brother with
            it?&quot; She nods. &quot;Well, it's just like that.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So, he pulls it out and she grabs hold of it and starts shaking it.
            A few seconds later, his head flops back on the headrest, his eyes
            close, snot starts to run out of his nose, wax blows out of his ear
            and he screams out in pain.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;What's wrong?!&quot; she cries out.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Take your thumb off the end!!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and a woman were having drinks when they
            got into an argument&nbsp;&nbsp; about who enjoyed sex more. The man
            said, &quot;Men obviously enjoy sex more than women. Why do you
            think we're so obsessed with getting laid?&quot; &quot;That doesn't
            prove anything,&quot; the woman countered. &quot;Think about
            this...when your ear itches and you put your finger in it and wiggle
            it around, then pull it out, which feels better-your ear or your
            finger?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The angry wife met her husband at the door.
            There was alcohol on his breath and lipstick on his collar. &quot;I
            assume,&quot; she snarled, &quot;that there is a very good reason
            for you to come waltzing in here at six o'clock in the
            morning?&quot; &quot;There is,&quot; he replied.
            &quot;Breakfast.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A husband and wife want to take golf lessons
            from a pro at a local country club. The man and woman meet the pro
            and head onto the driving range. The man goes up to hit first. He
            swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf pro says not bad.
            Golfpro: &quot;Now hold the club as firm as you hold your wife's
            breasts&quot;. The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300
            yards. The golf pro says &quot;Excellent!&quot; Now the woman takes
            her turn. Her ball goes 30 yards. Golfpro: &quot;Not bad, try
            holding the club like you hold your husbands dick.&quot; She swings
            and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: &quot;Not bad, but now try
            taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy is riding the bus when at a stop, the
            most beautiful woman he has ever seen gets on. The only problem is
            that she is a nun. He decides to approach her anyway. &quot;Sister,
            you are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and I must have sex
            with you.&quot; he says. &quot;I'm sorry but I've given my body to
            God&quot; she replies and then leaves. Suddenly the bus driver turns
            around to the guy and says &quot;I know a way you can get her in the
            sack.&quot; The bus driver tells the guy about how the nun goes to
            confessional everyday at 3 in the afternoon. The bus driver tells
            the guy his plan and the guy leaves happy knowing he's going to get
            some. The next day at 3 the guy is in the booth dressed as a priest.
            When the nun approaches in the darkness he says &quot;Sister, God
            has told me I must have sex with you.&quot; She replies &quot;Well
            if God has said it, we must do it. However because of my strong
            commitment to God I will only take it up the ass.&quot; The guy
            figures this isn't a problem and proceeds to have the best sex ever.
            After it is over he whips off his outfit and says &quot;Surprise I'm
            the guy on the bus&quot; With that the nun turns around and says
            &quot;Surprise I'm the bus driver.&quot;</p>

            <p>It's this man's 33rd birthday. He gets a
            package at the Post Office and goes to collect it. At the counter
            the woman brings his package to him, and the man says, &quot;It's my
            birthday today.&quot; &quot;Oh, happy birthday, how old are
            you?,&quot; asks the Post Office worker. &quot;33,&quot; says the
            man. &quot;Well, have a good day,&quot; says the worker. &quot;Thank
            you,&quot; replied the man. To get home, the man has to take the
            bus. At the bus stop an old lady walks up and waits soon after he
            arrives. The man says to the old lady, &quot;It's my birthday
            today.&quot; &quot;Oh, happy birthday,&quot; says the old lady.
            &quot;I'm...&quot; &quot;No don't tell me,&quot; interjects the old
            lady, &quot;I know a unique way of telling how old somebody
            is.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah? What's that then,&quot; asks the man.
            &quot;If I can feel your balls for about 5 minutes, I can tell
            exactly how many years old you are,&quot; says the old lady. &quot;I
            don't believe it.&quot; &quot;Well let me prove it!&quot; &quot;I'm
            not going to let you feel my balls!,&quot; says the man. &quot;Oh
            well, I guess you'll never know then,&quot; replies the lady. After
            a couple of minutes curiosity gets the better of the man and he
            says, &quot;Oh, okay then, you can do it.&quot; After a good feel of
            the man's balls the woman finally takes her hands out of his pants.
            &quot;You are 33 years old exactly,&quot; she exclaims! &quot;How
            the fuck did you know that?!,&quot; exclaims the man, impressed.
            &quot;I was behind you in the line at the Post Office,&quot; said
            the lady.</p>

            <p>After the annual office Christmas party
            blow-out, John woke up with a pounding headache, cotton-mouthed, and
            utterly unable to recall the events of the preceding evening. After
            a trip to the bathroom he was able to make his way downstairs, where
            his wife put some coffee in front of him. &quot;Louise,&quot; he
            moaned, &quot;tell me what went on last night. Was it as bad as I
            think?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Even worse,&quot; she assured him in her most scornful one.
            &quot;You made a complete ass of yourself, succeeded in antagonizing
            the entire board of directors, and insulted the chairman of the
            company to his face.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;He's an arrogant, self-important prick, piss on him!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;You did. All over his suit, &quot; Louise informed him.
            &quot;And he fired you.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well, fuck him,&quot; said John.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I did. You're back at work on Monday.&quot;</p>

            <p>Two dwarfs decide to treat themselves to a
            vacation in Las Vegas. At the hotel bar, they're dazzled by two
            women, and wind up taking them to their separate rooms.<br />
            <br />
            The first dwarf is disappointed, however, as he's unable to reach a
            certain physical state that would enable him to join with his date.
            His depression is enhanced by the fact that, from the next room, he
            hears cries of ONE, TWO, THREE...HUH! all night long.<br />
            <br />
            In the morning, the second dwarf asks the first, How did it go? The
            first whispers back: It was so embarrassing. I simply couldn't get
            an erection. The second dwarf shook his head. You think that's
            embarrassing? I couldn't<br />
            even get on the bed!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and woman were dating and he asked her
            to marry him. She told him to prove his love to her she wanted him
            to get her name, Wendy, tattooed on his penis. When it was erect is
            said Wendy and when it was limp if said Wy. They got married and
            went to Jamaica to a nude beach for their honeymoon. Wendy told her
            husband to go get them a drink so he went to a stand on the beach
            and noticed the man who was waiting on him also has a Wy on his
            penis. He said oh you must have a wife named Wendy to and the waiter
            said no mine says Welcome to Jamaica man have a nice day!!!</p>

            <p>A husband and his wife who have been married
            20 years were doing some yard work. The man was working hard
            cleaning the BBQ grill while his wife was bending over, weeding
            flowers from the flower bed. So the man says to his wife &quot;Your
            rear end is almost as wide as this grill&quot; She ignores the
            remark.<br />
            <br />
            A little later, the husband takes his measuring tape and measures
            the grill, then he goes over to his wife while she is bending over,
            measures her rear end and gasps, &quot;Geez, it really IS as wide as
            the grill!&quot; She ignores this remark as well.<br />
            <br />
            Later that night while in bed, her husband starts to feel frisky.
            The wife calmly responds, &quot;If you think I'm gonna fire up the
            grill for one little wiener, you are sadly mistaken.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A couple decided to Alaska for a romantic
            weekend. When they got to the cabin it was cold so the wife asked
            her husband to go chop some wood for that fire place. He came in
            after 5 minutes and told his wife that his hands were cold, so she
            said her put your hands between my thighs to warm them. So he did
            and went back outside to finish chopping wood. He came in after
            another 5 minutes and said &quot; honey my hands are cold
            again&quot;. So she tells him here put your hands between my thighs
            to warm them. So he did and then he went back out to chop some more
            wood. 5 minutes has passed and he went in again and said,
            &quot;honey my hands are cold again&quot;. She then said, &quot;
            Damn don't your ears ever get cold?&quot;</p>

            <p>A guy walks into a bar and orders 12 tequilas.
            The bartender asked, &quot;what's wrong,&quot; and the guy says that
            he just found out that his younger son is gay. The bartender says,
            &quot;he's sorry about it.&quot; After a couple of days the guy
            comes back and orders 15 tequilas. The bartender asked, &quot;What's
            wrong now,&quot; to which the guy responds That he found out that
            his older son was gay, too. The bartender says that he's sorry. The
            guy returned a few days later and ordered 20 tequilas. The bartender
            burst out, &quot;Isn't anyone in your family gettin' any

            <p>Woman rushes into her house one morning and
            yells to her husband,<br />
            &quot;Sam, pack up your stuff. I just won the lottery!&quot;<br />
            &quot;Shall I pack for warm weather or cold?&quot;<br />
            &quot;Whatever. Just so you're out of the house by noon!&quot;</p>

            <p>A woman walked into a very busy butcher's
            shop. Looking at meats and poultry on display, she suddenly grabbed
            hold of a dressed chicken, she picked up one wing, sniffed it,
            picked up the other wing and sniffed it, picked up one leg, sniffed
            it, picked up the other leg, sniffed it. Just as she finished
            sniffing the second leg, the butcher walked up to her and said,
            &quot;Madam, could -you- pass such a test?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>It is two o'clock in the morning and a husband
            and his wife are asleep when suddenly the phone rings. The husband
            picks up the phone and before he can say anything, some talking came
            from the other end of the line and the husband says &quot;How the
            heck do I know - what am I, the weather man?&quot; and promptly
            slams the phone down. His wife rolls over and asks, &quot;Who was
            that?&quot; The husband replies, &quot;I don't know, it was some
            bloke who wanted to know if the coast was clear.&quot;</p>

            <p>Three people walked by a strip bar they walked
            in, the first guy licks a 100 dollar bill and slaps it on one side
            of her butt. The next guy also, licks a 100 dollar bill and slaps it
            on the other side of her butt. The third guy walks in takes out a
            credit card swipes it through her butt and takes the 200 dollars.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man with no ears is trying to find a new
            reporter for their news show. The first guy walks in and the boss
            says, &quot;This job requires you noticing a lot of details. What is
            one thing you notice about me?&quot; And the guy says, &quot;Well
            shit! You got no ears man!&quot; So the boss yells &quot;Get the
            fuck out!&quot;. So the next guy comes in and the boss says to him,
            &quot;This job requires you noticing a lot of details. What is
            something you notice about me?&quot; And the guy says, &quot;That's
            easy. You got no ears!&quot; So the boss says, to him, &quot;Get the
            fuck out!&quot; As the second guy leaves he sees the third guy about
            to go in and says to him, &quot;The boss has no ears so don't say
            anything about them, he is really sensitive about it.&quot; So the
            guy goes in and the boss says, &quot;This job requires you to notice
            a lot of details. What is one that you notice about me?&quot; So the
            guy says, &quot;Your wearing contacts!&quot; And the boss says,
            &quot;Yeah, how did you know?&quot; So the guy replies, &quot;Well
            shit, you can't wear glasses cause you ain't got no ears.&quot;</p>

            <p>A woman is picked up by Dennis Rodman in a
            bar. They like each other and she goes back with him to his hotel
            room. He removes his shirt revealing all his tattoos and she sees
            that on his arm is one which reads, &quot;Reebok&quot;. She thinks
            that's a bit odd and asks him about it. Dennis says, &quot;When I
            play basketball, the cameras pick up the tattoo and Reebok pays me
            for advertisement.&quot; A bit later, his pants are off and she sees
            &quot;Puma&quot; tattooed on his leg. He gives the same explanation
            for the unusual tattoo. Finally, the underwear comes off and she
            sees the word &quot;AIDS&quot; tattooed on his penis. She jumps back
            with shock. &quot;I'm not going to do it with a guy who has
            AIDS!&quot; He says, &quot;It's cool baby, in a minute it's going to
            say &quot;ADIDAS&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was once this cowboy, riding through the
            wild west. One day, off in the distance, he sees a small cloud of
            dust. So he rides his horse up to it, and finds its an Indian laying
            on the ground with his chop sticking out of his pants! The cowboy
            gets off his horse and asks, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;, to
            which the Indian replies, &quot;Me tell time! Penis acts as
            sundial.&quot; The cowboy in disbelief says, &quot;Ok, what time is
            it?&quot; The Indian looks down at his &quot;3:35...&quot;
            &quot;That's amazing, your right!&quot; the cowboy says in
            amazement. So he hops onto his horse and keeps going.</p>
            <p>Riding along further, he sees the same thing,
            gets off his horse, and thinking the last Indian was a fluke, asks
            this one the time. The Indian looks down at his &quot;one eyed
            bandit&quot; and says &quot;4:40&quot;. The cowboy is stunned, the
            time was right again! Shaking his head he hops back onto his horse
            and rides again.</p>
            <p>After riding a while again, he sees yet
            another Indian on the ground with his &quot;bald headed champ&quot;
            except he was jerking off. The cowboy hops off his horse and says,
            &quot;And what are you doing?&quot; to which the Indian replies,
            &quot;Me winding clock.&quot;</p>

            <p>A man was walking along a California beach and
            stumbled across an old lamp.&nbsp; He picked it up and rubbed it and
            out popped a genie!<br />
            <br />
            The genie said, &quot;OK.&nbsp; You released me from the lamp, blah,
            blah blah. This is the fourth time this month and I'm getting a
            little sick of these wishes.&nbsp; So you can forget about getting
            three wishes.&nbsp; You only get one wish.<br />
            <br />
            The man sat down on the beach and thought about it for awhile.&nbsp;
            Then he said, &quot;I've always wanted to go to Hawaii; but I'm
            scared to fly and I get very seasick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you build me
            a bridge to Hawaii so that I can drive over there to visit?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The genie laughed and said, &quot;That's impossible!&nbsp; Think of
            the logistics of that!&nbsp;&nbsp; How would the supports ever reach
            the bottom of the Pacific?&nbsp; Think of how much concrete... how
            much steel...!&nbsp; No. Think of another wish.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The man tried to think of another wish.&nbsp; Finally, he said,
            &quot;I've been married and divorced several times.&nbsp; My wives
            always said that I don't care and that I'm insensitive.&nbsp; So I
            wish that I could understand women... know how they feel inside and
            what they're thinking when they give me the silent treatment...know
            why they're crying...know what they really want when they say,
            'Nothing'...know how to make them truly happy....&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The genie said, &quot;You want that bridge two lanes or four?&quot;</p>
