            <hr />
            <p>Saturday morning I got up early, put on my long 
		johns, dressed quietly, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, slipped quietly 
		into the garage to hook the boat up to the truck, and proceeded to back 
		out into a torrential downpour.<br />
		<br />
		There was snow mixed with the rain and the wind was blowing 50 mph. I 
		pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that 
		the weather would be bad throughout the day.<br />
		<br />
		I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into 
		bed. There I cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different 
		anticipation, and whispered, &quot;The weather out there is terrible.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		She sleepily replied,<br />
		<br />
		&quot;Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that shit.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A husband and wife and their two sons are watching 
		TV. She looks at her husband and winks at him, he gets the message and 
		says, &quot;Excuse us for a few minutes boys, we're going up to our room for 
		a little while.&quot; <br />
		<br />
		Pretty soon one of the boys becomes curious, goes upstairs and sees the 
		door to his parents bedroom is ajar. He peeks in for a few minutes, 
		trots downstairs, gets his little brother and takes him up to peek into 
		the bedroom. <br />
		<br />
		&quot;Before you look in there,&quot; he says, &quot;keep in mind this is the same 
		woman who smacked our asses just for sucking our thumbs.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A recently widowed Jewish lady, was sitting on a 
		beach towel at Cocoa Beach, Florida. She looked up and noticed that a 
		man her age had walked up, placed his blanket on the sand nearby and 
		began reading a book.<br />
		<br />
		Smiling, she attempted to strike up a conversation with him. &quot;Hello, 
		sir, how are you?&quot;<br />
		<br />
		&quot;Fine, thank you,&quot; he responded, and turned back to his book.<br />
		<br />
		&quot;I love the beach. Do you come here often?&quot; she asked.<br />
		<br />
		&quot;First time since my wife passed away last year,&quot; he replied, and again 
		turned back to his book.<br />
		<br />
		&quot;Do you live around here?&quot; she asked.<br />
		<br />
		&quot;Yes, I live over in Suntree,&quot; he answered, and then resumed reading.<br />
		<br />
		Trying to find a topic of common interest, Sarah persisted. &quot;Do you like 
		pussycats?&quot;<br />
		With that, the man threw his book down, jumped off his blanket onto 
		hers, tore off both their swimsuits and gave her the most passionate 
		ride of her life!<br />
		<br />
		As the cloud of sand began to settle, Sarah gasped and asked the man, 
		&quot;How did you know that was what I wanted?&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The man replied, &quot;How did you know my name was Katz?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
      <p>This recovering alcoholic is down town to pick up 
		his income tax return. He passes by a bar and turns to go inside. He 
		stops and thinks to himself &quot;If I go in here and get drunk, my wife will 
		leave me&quot;. He makes a promise to himself to only have a couple beers and 
		then leave. Well he goes in and gets wasted. As he sits at the bar, he 
		pukes down the front of his shirt. Immediately he breaks out into tears 
		sobbing &quot;My wife is going to leave me. I'm just a miserable old drunk 
		and now I'm going to die alone&quot;. The guy sitting next to him turns and 
		says to the drunk guy &quot;It's not that bad. You can get out of this.&quot; The 
		drunk looks at him and asks how in the world is he going to get out of 
		this? The guy says &quot;Take a $5 bill and put it in your shirt pocket. When 
		you get home, tell her you had a couple beers and a guy puked on you.</p>
		<p>Tell her that the $5 was given to you to pay for 
		the shirt.&quot; The drunk guy looks disbelievingly at him and says &quot;That 
		just might work. You are a saint. Thank you.&quot; The drunk guys goes 
		straight home. When he walks through the front door, his wife is waiting 
		for him and she is irate. She takes one look at him and screams &quot;I can't 
		believe it. You're drunk. I warned you but you just don't care. I'm 
		moving out.&quot; The drunk says &quot;Stop honey. Let me explain. True I did have 
		a couple beers but I'm not drunk.&quot; She says &quot; Look at you... you puked 
		down the front of your shirt.&quot; He says &quot;I didn't do this. A drunk guy 
		next to me puked on me. He put a $5 bill in my shirt pocket to pay for 
		the shirt. You can see for yourself&quot; She reaches into his pocket and 
		pulls out some money. She looks at it, then to him and says &quot;This is a 
		$10 bill&quot; He looks at her and says &quot;Oh I forgot. He shit my pants too&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy walks into a bar with his midget wife and 
		takes a stool, with his wife standing next to him. The bartender was 
		busy at the other end and didn't see them when they walked in. When he 
		got done serving the customers there, he walked down the bar and asks 
		the new customer what he would like. He asks for two glasses of beer, 
		which the barman brings. After leaving him, the bartender goes about 
		serving other patrons, when he notices the man has finished his beers. 
		He asks if he would like a refill, and the man says, &quot;Yes. I'll have a 
		couple more. &quot;The barman gets two more beers and sets them in front of 
		the man. Never having seen anyone with the guy, his curiosity is piqued, 
		and he asks him, &quot;Why, do you order two drinks at a time?&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The man replies, &quot;Oh, one is for me, and the other for my wife.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		Astounded, having not seen the midget wife, the bartender says,
		&quot;Your wife? Where is she?&quot;<br />
		<br />
		&quot;She's standing here next to me.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The bartender, standing on his toes, leaning forward looking over
		the edge of the bar, utters, &quot;Well, I'll be God damned, she ain't any
		bigger than your fist!&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The man replies, &quot;No, but she's a lot better!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man goes to a restaurant and orders a chicken 
		dish. By the time the food is ready and he is about to eat, the waiter 
		comes back and says, &quot;Sir, I'm afraid there has been a mistake. You see, 
		that police officer who is sitting at the next table is a regular 
		customer of ours and he usually orders the same dish. The problem is, 
		this is the last chicken in the house. I'm afraid I'll have to take this 
		dish to him and arrange for another dish for you!&quot; <br />
		<br />
		The guy gets really upset and refuses to give up his food. The waiter 
		walks over to the other table and explains the situation to the officer. 
		A few minutes later the officer walks over to the man's table and says, 
		&quot;Listen and listen good. That is MY chicken you are about to eat and 
		I'll warn you, whatever you do to that chicken I'll do the same to you. 
		You pull out one of its legs, I'll pull out one of yours. You break one 
		of its wings, I'll break one of your arms!&quot; <br />
		<br />
		The man calmly looks at the chicken, then sticks his middle finger in 
		the bird's rectum, pulls it out and licks it. He then gets up, drops his 
		pants, bends over and says, &quot;Go ahead!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>An old man in the nursing home got a bottle of wine 
		for his birthday. He talked the old lady in the next room into sharing 
		it with him. <br />
		<br />
		After they were both totally bombed, he started groping the old lady and 
		pulling at her clothes. He managed to get her blouse and bra off before 
		she stopped him. <br />
		<br />
		She said, &quot;I can't do this, I have acute angina&quot;. <br />
		<br />
		The old guy says &quot;God, I hope so, you've got the ugliest tits I've ever 
		seen.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man from Texas buys a round of drinks for everyone 
		in the bar as he announces his wife has just produced &quot;A typical Texas 
		baby boy weighing twenty pounds.&quot; Congratulations shower all around, and 
		many exclamations of 'wow!' are heard. Two weeks later he returns to the 
		bar. The bartender says, 'Say, you're the father of the typical Texas 
		baby that weighed twenty pounds at birth, aren't you? How much does the 
		baby weigh now?' The proud father answers, 'fifteen pounds.' The 
		bartender is puzzled. 'Why? What happened? He already weighed twenty 
		pounds at birth.' The Texas father takes a slow sip from his beer, wipes 
		his lips on his shirt sleeve, leans over to the bartender and proudly 
		announces, 'Had him circumcised.'</p>

            <p>One day a single mother was in the grocery store 
		with her 4 kids. They were acting up. Bad little kids. They were running 
		around grabbing items off the shelves crying and screaming all over the 
		place. The mother grabbed all and said &quot;I should of swallowed all of 
		you!&quot; </p>

            <p>The difference between having Guts and having 
		Balls...<br />
		<br />
		Guts is arriving home late after a night out with the guys, being 
		assaulted by your wife with a broom, and having the guts to ask: &quot;Are 
		you still cleaning, or are you flying somewhere?&quot;<br />
		<br />
		Balls is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of 
		perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the ass 
		and having the balls to say, &quot;You're next.&quot;</p>

      <p>A policeman sends his wife and kid to a resort for a 
		vacation. After a week he joined them in the hotel. As soon as he came 
		to the hotel room he wanted to make love to his wife and gave her &quot;the 
		look&quot;. Whispering under her breath, the wife says &quot;No darling, we can't 
		do it here, our kid is watching!&quot; Husband replies, &quot;You&#39;re right, lets 
		go to the beach.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		After a while they make their way to the beach, they start to make love 
		on an empty beach. All of a sudden, a policeman walks up to them. &quot;Put 
		your cloths on immediately, shame on you, you can't do that in public!&quot; 
		Embarrassed, the husband admits &quot;You are right, but I had a moment of 
		weakness. We hadn&#39;t seen each other for an entire week. Now, I&#39;m a 
		policeman too, and it would be very embarrassing if you fine me.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The cop thought for a second and said &quot;Don't worry... you are a 
		colleague and it is your first time. But this is the third time I caught 
		this bitch making love on this beach in the last week and she will have 
		to pay.&quot;</p>
      <hr color="#000000" style="height: 1px">
      		<p>Late one night a woman was walking home when a man 
		grabbed her and dragged her into the bushes.<br />
		<br />
		&quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; she screamed. &quot;I'm being robbed!&quot; <br />
		<br />
		&quot;You ain't being robbed&quot; her attacker interrupted. &quot;You're being 
		screwed!&quot; <br />
		<br />
		The woman looked down at her attacker as he unzipped his jeans. &quot;If 
		you're screwing me with that,&quot; she fumed, &quot;I am being robbed!&quot;</p>

      		<p>A psychiatrist is addressing a group of people who 
		have all had experiences with the supernatural. He asks: &quot;Who here has 
		seen a ghost?&quot; Everyone puts up their hands. He then asks: &quot;Who here has 
		spoken with a ghost?&quot; Half the audience puts up their hands. &quot;And who 
		here has touched a ghost?&quot; Ten percent of the crowd puts up their hands. 
		He asks: &quot;And who here has made love with a ghost?&quot; One little man in 
		the back row puts up his hand... The psychiatrist looks down from the 
		podium at the little man and says: &quot;Do you mean to tell me that you have 
		made love with a ghost?&quot; The man replies, &quot;Oh No! I'm sorry. I couldn't 
		hear you correctly. I thought you said 'goat'.&quot;</p>
