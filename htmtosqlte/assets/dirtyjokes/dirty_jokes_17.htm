            <p>The racing-car driver picked up a girl after a
            race, went home with her and took her to bed. He fell asleep only to
            be awakened suddenly when she smacked him in the face. &quot;What's
            the matter?!? Didn't I satisfy you when we screwed?&quot; he asked.
            &quot;It was after you fell asleep that got you into trouble,&quot;
            said the angry woman. &quot;In your sleep, you felt my tits and
            mumbled, 'What perfect headlights.' Then you felt my thighs and
            murmured, 'what a smooth finish.'&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot; asked the driver. &quot;Nothing,
            but then you felt my pussy and yelled, 'who the hell left the garage
            door open?'&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There were three prostitutes living together,
            a mother, daughter and grandmother. One night the daughter came home
            looking very down. &quot;How did you get on tonight Dear?&quot;
            asked her mother. &quot;Not too good,&quot; replied the daughter.
            &quot;I only got $20 for a blow job.&quot; &quot;Wow!&quot; said the
            mother, &quot;In my day we gave a blow job for 50 cents!&quot;
            &quot;Good God!&quot; said the Grandmother. &quot;In my day we were
            just glad to get something warm in our stomachs!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A tall woman met a midget at a party. The
            midget was barely three feet tall but they were attracted to each
            other. After a few drinks they went back to the tall woman's
            apartment. &quot;I can't imagine what it will be like making love to
            a midget,&quot; said the woman, &quot;especially with the size
            difference and all.&quot; &quot;Just take off your cloths, lie back
            on the bed, spread your legs apart and close your eyes,&quot; said
            the midget. The woman did as she was told and soon she felt the
            biggest thing she'd ever experienced inside her. Within a few
            minutes the woman had climaxed eight times. &quot;If you think that
            was good,&quot; said the midget with a smirk, &quot;Just wait till I
            get BOTH legs in there!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and a woman had been married some time
            when the woman began to question her husband. &quot;I know you've
            been with a lot of woman before. How many were there?&quot; The
            husband replied, &quot;Look, I don't want to upset you, there were
            many. Let's just leave it alone.&quot; The wife continued to beg and
            plead. Finally, the husband gave in. &quot;Let's see.&quot; he said
            &quot;There was one, two, three, four, five, six, you, eight,
            nine...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>&quot;That wife of mine is a liar,&quot; said
            the angry husband to a sympathetic pal seated next to him in the
            bar. &quot;How do you know?&quot; the friend asked. &quot;She didn't
            come home last night, and when I asked her where she'd been, she
            said she'd spent the night with her sister, Shirley.&quot;
            &quot;So?&quot; the friend replied. &quot;So, she's a liar. I spent
            the night with her sister Shirley!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young girl gets married and a few days later
            her mother comes to visit. When she arrives, she is shocked to find
            her daughter standing naked at the front door. &quot;What are you
            doing!&quot; insists her mother. &quot;Mom, it's my love dress!
            Don't you like it?&quot; &quot;I'll come back in a few weeks when
            the honeymoon is over,&quot; replies her mother, as she turns and
            leaves for the car.<br />
            <br />
            A few weeks later, the mother arrives at her daughter's house once.
            Again, she is shocked when her naked daughter answers the door to
            greet her. &quot;Now what are you doing?&quot; &quot;Mom, it's my
            love dress! It keeps the marriage spicy!&quot; &quot;I'll give you a
            few more weeks,&quot; replies her mother, as she turns and leaves
            for the car.<br />
            <br />
            Later that night, the mother decides to try it for herself. When her
            husband arrives home, she greets him at the front door in the nude.
            &quot;Honey, what are hell are you doing!&quot; remarks the husband.
            &quot;It's my love dress, dear! What do you think of it?&quot;
            &quot;Well, to be perfectly honest,&quot; replies her husband,
            &quot;I think you should have ironed it first!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>An old maid wanted to travel by bus to the pet
            cemetery with the remains of her cat. As she boarded the bus, she
            whispered to the driver, &quot;I have a dead pussy.&quot; The driver
            pointed to the woman in the seat behind him and said, &quot;Sit with
            my wife. You two have a lot in common.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>In pharmacology, all drugs have a generic
            name, Tylenol is Acetaminophen, Advil is Ibuprofen, and so on. The
            FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra, and announced
            today that they have settled on Mycoxafloppin.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A waitress walks up to one of her tables in a
            New York City restaurant and notices that the three Japanese
            businessmen seated there are furiously masturbating. She says,
            &quot;What the hell do you guys think you are doing?&quot; One of
            the Japanese men says, &quot;Can't you see? We are all berry
            hungry.&quot; The waitress says, &quot;So how is whacking-off in the
            middle of the restaurant going to help that situation??&quot; One of
            the other businessmen replies: &quot;The menu say, FIRST COME, FIRST
            SERVED!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy walks into a local pharmacy and walks up
            to the counter where a lady pharmacist is filling prescriptions.
            When she finally gets around to helping him he says, &quot;I'd like
            99 condoms please&quot;. With a surprised look on her face the
            pharmacist says, &quot;99 Condoms!?! Fuck me!&quot; to which the guy
            replies, &quot;Make it 100 then...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>John woke up one morning with an enormous
            erection so he turned over to his wife's side of the bed. His wife,
            Heather, had already awakened though, and she was downstairs
            preparing breakfast in the kitchen. Afraid that he might spoil
            things by getting up, John called his little boy into the room and
            asked him to bring it to his wife. The note read:<br />
            <br />
            The Tent Pole Is Up,<br />
            The Canvas Is Spread,<br />
            The Hell With Breakfast,<br />
            Come Back To Bed.<br />
            <br />
            Heather answered the note and then asked her son to bring it to her
            husband. The note read:<br />
            <br />
            Take The Tent Pole Down,<br />
            Put The Canvas Away,<br />
            The Monkey Had A Hemorrhage,<br />
            No Circus Today.<br />
            <br />
            John read the note and quickly scribbled a reply. Then, he asked his
            son to bring it to his wife. The note read:<br />
            <br />
            The Tent Pole's Still Up,<br />
            And The Canvas Still Spread,<br />
            So Drop What You're Doing,<br />
            And Come Give Me Some Head.<br />
            <br />
            Heather answered the note and then asked her son to bring it to her
            husband. The note read:<br />
            <br />
            I'm Sure That Your Pole's<br />
            The Best In The Land.<br />
            But I'm Busy Right Now,<br />
            So Do It By Hand!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man walked into a therapist's office looking
            very depressed. &quot;Doc, you've got to help me. I can't go on like
            this.&quot; &quot;What's the problem?&quot; the doctor inquired.
            &quot;Well, I'm 35 years old and I still have no luck with the
            ladies. No matter how hard I try, I just seem to scare them
            away.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;My friend, this is not a serious problem. You just need to
            work on your self-esteem. Each morning, I want you to get up and run
            to the bathroom mirror. Tell yourself that you are a good person, a
            fun person, and an attractive person. But, say it with real
            conviction. Within a week you'll have women buzzing all around
            you.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The man seemed content with this advice and walked out of the office
            a bit excited. Three weeks later he returned with the same
            downtrodden expression on his face. &quot;Did my advice not
            work?&quot; asked the doctor.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh, it worked alright. For the past several weeks I've enjoyed
            some of the best moments in my life with the most fabulous looking
            women.&quot; &quot;So, what's your problem?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I don't have a problem,&quot; the man replied. &quot;My wife
            does.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two Amish women were picking potatoes one
            autumn day. The first Amish woman had 2 potatoes in her hands. She
            looked at the other woman and said, &quot;these potatoes remind me
            of my husbands testicles&quot;, and the other woman said &quot;are
            his testicles that big?&quot; , no she commented, &quot;they're that
            dirty&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A major Hollywood star decided to do a charity
            dinner and invited hundreds of people to take part. To make it
            interesting, the host decided to make it a costume party with the
            theme of emotions. So that night, the first couple came to the front
            door, dressed in all blue. &quot;You were supposed to dress up as an
            emotion&quot; states the doorman. &quot;We are dressed in all blue
            because we picked the sad emotion.&quot; Thinking it over, the
            doorman decided that was good enough. The next couple comes up to
            the door dressed in all red clothing &quot;Sorry, you needed to
            dress up in a costume tonight!&quot;, to which the couple reply,
            &quot;We are, our red clothes symbolize we are angry. Besides, you
            let the other couple before us in.&quot; Again, the doorman agrees
            to let them in.<br />
            <br />
            Then along comes a black guy, completely naked with the exception of
            a pear with the core cut out and his penis stuck into it. The
            doorman, wide eyed looks at him, &quot;I'm sorry, but I don't think
            you have been invited to this dinner.&quot; To which the black man
            responds in a thick Jamaican accent, &quot;Actually I was
            invited!&quot;,&quot;Well you were supposed to be dressed up in a
            costume that conveys a certain emotion.&quot; The black guy says,
            &quot;I am in a costume, I'm deep in despair!&quot; (Deep in this
            pear)</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Jon left for a two day business trip to
            Chicago. He was only a few blocks away from his house when he
            realized he'd left his plane ticket on top of his dresser. He turned
            around and headed back to the house. He quietly entered the door,
            walked into the kitchen. He saw his wife washing the breakfast
            dishes, wearing her skimpiest negligee.<br />
            <br />
            She looked so good that he tiptoed up behind her, reached out, and
            squeezed her left tit. &quot;Leave only one quart of milk,&quot; she
            said. &quot;Jon won't be here for breakfast tomorrow.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This guy is banging this girl, the girl asks,
            &quot;You haven't got aids have you?&quot; He replies,
            &quot;No.&quot; She responds, &quot;Oh, thank fuck for that! I don't
            want to get that again!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman asks her husband if he'd like some
            breakfast. &quot;Bacon and eggs, perhaps a slice of toast? Maybe a
            nice sectioned grapefruit, and a cup of fresh coffee?&quot; He
            declines. &quot;It's this Viagra,&quot; he says, &quot;it's really
            taken the edge off my appetite.&quot; At lunch time, she asks if he
            would like something. &quot;A bowl of home made soup, maybe, with a
            cheese sandwich? Or how about a plate of snacks and a glass of
            milk?&quot; Again he declines. &quot;No, thanks. It's this
            Viagra,&quot; he says, &quot;It's really taken the edge off my
            appetite.&quot; At dinner time, she asks if he wants anything to
            eat, offering to go to the cafe and buy him a burger supper.
            &quot;Or would you rather I make you a pizza from scratch? Or, how
            about a tasty stir fry? That'll only take a couple of
            minutes...?&quot; Once more, he declines. &quot;Again, thanks, but
            it's this Viagra. It's really taken the edge off my appetite.&quot;
            &quot;Well, then&quot;, she says, &quot;Would you mind getting off
            me? I'm fucking STARVING!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A woman goes to her doctor and
            says she wants an operation because her vagina lips are much to
            large. She asks the doctor to keep the operation a secret as she's
            embarrassed and doesn't want anyone to find out. The doctor agrees.</p>
            <p align="left">She wakes up from her operation
            and finds three roses carefully placed beside her bed. Outraged she
            immediately calls in the doctor and says, &quot;I thought I asked
            you not to tell anyone about my operation!&quot; &quot;Don't
            worry,&quot; he says, &quot;I didn't tell anybody. The first rose is
            from me. I felt bad because you went through this all by yourself.
            The second one is from the nurse. She assisted me with the
            operation, and she had the operation done herself.&quot; &quot;Who
            is the third rose from?&quot; she asked. &quot;Oh,&quot; says the
            doctor, &quot;that rose is from the guy upstairs in the burn unit.
            He wanted to thank you for his new ears!&quot;</p>
