            <p>There was a little boy who had just learned to
            count on his fingers. One day his uncle came to visit and the boy
            was anxious to show off his newly acquired skill. He told the uncle
            to ask him and addition question. So they uncle asked, &quot;What is
            three plus four?&quot; The little boy counts it out on his fingers
            and said, &quot;Seven.&quot; The uncle said, &quot;Listen kid, you
            cant count it out on your hands because someday when you are in
            school, a teacher will get mad at you for it. Now put your hands in
            your pockets.&quot; So the little boy put his hands in his pockets
            and his uncle asked, &quot;What is five plus five?&quot; The uncle
            saw movement in the boys pockets, then the boy said,
            &quot;Eleven.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A man went into a pharmacy and
            asked to talk to a male pharmacist. The&nbsp;woman he was talking to
            said that she was the pharmacist and that she&nbsp;and her sister
            owned the store, so there were no males employed there. She then
            asked if there was something she could help&nbsp; the gentleman
            with. The man said &quot;this is embarrassing&nbsp; for me, but I
            have a permanent erection which causes me a lot of problems and
            severe embarrassment. I was wondering what you could give me for
            it?&quot; The pharmacist said &quot;Just a minute, I'll go talk to
            my sister.&quot; When she returned, she said, &quot;the best we can
            do is 1/3 ownership in the store and $3000 a month in living
            expenses.</p>

            <p align="left">During a wild party at a Long
            Island country house, Roxanne had too much to drink and strolled
            outside for some air. Getting to a grassy field, she lay down to
            watch the stars. Roxanne was almost asleep when a cow, searching for
            clover, carefully stepped over her. Groggily, she raised her head
            and said, &quot;One at a time boys, one at a time.&quot;</p>

            <p>One day an 85-year-old man is taking a stroll
            around his hometown, which he has lived in for his whole life. As he
            sees the landmarks, homes, and streets from his youth, he starts
            reminiscing....<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I remember helping build that bridge when I was 25. I worked
            hard on that. But people won't call you 'the bridge builder' if you
            do that here. No, no, they don't!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I remember building that house over there when I was 30. But
            people won't call you 'the house builder' if you do that. No, no
            they don't!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I remember building that tavern that I still lounge at when I
            was 35. If you do that people won't call you 'the tavern builder'
            either. They sure won't!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;But if you fuck one goat.......&quot;</p>

            <p>Twelve monks were about to be ordained. The
            final test was for them to line up, nude, in a garden while a nude
            model danced before them. Each monk had a small bell attached to his
            privates, and they were told that anyone whose bell rang would not
            be ordained because he had not reached a state of spiritual purity.<br />
            <br />
            The model danced before the first monk candidate, with no reaction.
            She proceeded down the line with the same response until she got to
            the final monk. As she danced, his bell rang so loudly it fell off
            and clattered to the ground. Embarrassed, he bent down to pick up
            the bell, and eleven other bells began to ring......</p>

            <p align="left">A local law enforcement officer
            stopped a car for traveling faster than the posted speed limit.
            Since he was in a good mood that day he decided to give the poor
            fellow a break and write him out a warning instead of a&nbsp;ticket.
            So, he asks the man his name.&quot; Fred&quot; he replies.
            &quot;Fred what?&quot; the officer asks. &quot;Just Fred&quot; the
            man responds. When the officer presses him for a last name, the man
            tells him that he used to have a last name but lost it. The officer
            thinks he has a nutcase on his hands but plays along with it.
            &quot;Tell me Fred, how did you lose your last name?&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">The man replies... &quot;It's a
            long story so stay with me. I was born Fred Dingaling. I know, funny
            last name. The kids used to tease me all the time. So I stayed to
            myself. I studied hard and got good grades. When I got older I
            realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I went through college,
            medical school, internship, residency, finally got my degree so I
            was Fred Dingaling, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor so
            I decided to go back to school. Dentistry was my dream. Got all the
            way through school, got my degree so I was now Fred Dingaling MD
            DDS. Got bored doing dentistry so I started fooling around with my
            assistant. She gave me VD. So, I was Fred Dingaling MD DDS with VD.
            Well, the ADA found out about the VD so they took away my DDS so I
            was Fred Dingaling MD with VD. Then the AMA found out about the ADA
            taking away my DDS because of the VD, so they took away my MD
            leaving me as Fred Dingaling with VD. Then the VD took away my
            dingaling so now I'm just Fred.&quot; The officer let him go without
            even a warning. :-)</p>

            conversation during there lunch break. Nina asks, &quot;So, Liz,
            how's your sex life these days?&quot; Liz replies, &quot;Oh, you
            know. It's the usual, Social Security kind.&quot; &quot;Social
            Security?&quot; Nina asked quizzically. &quot;Yeah, you get a little
            each month, but it's not enough to live on.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="left">Three women were sitting around
            talking about their husbands' performance as a lover. The first
            woman says &quot;My Husband works as a marriage counselor. He always
            buys me flowers and candy before we make love. I like that.&quot;
            The second woman says, &quot;My husband is a motorcycle mechanic. He
            likes to play rough and slaps me around sometimes. I kinda like
            that.&quot; The third woman just shakes her head and says, &quot;My
            husband works for Microsoft. He just sits on the edge of the bed and
            tells me how great it's going to be when I get it.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A farmer and his wife were lying
            in bed one evening; she was knitting, and he was reading the latest
            issue of Animal Husbandry. He looked up from the page and said to
            her, &quot;Did you know that humans are the only species in which
            the female achieves orgasm?&quot; She looked at him wistfully,
            smiled, and replied, &quot;Oh, yeah? Prove it.&quot; He frowned for
            a moment, then said, &quot;Okay.&quot; He got up and walked out,
            leaving his wife with a confused look on her face. About a half hour
            later, he returned all tired and sweaty and proclaimed, &quot;Well,
            I'm sure the cow and sheep didn't, but the way that pig is always
            squealing, how can I tell?&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">It was the stir of the town when
            an 80-year-old man married a 20-year-old girl. After a year she went
            into the hospital to give birth. The nurse came out to congratulate
            the fellow. &quot;This is amazing. How do you do it at your
            age?&quot; He answered, &quot;You've got to keep that old motor
            running.&quot; The following year she gave birth again. The same
            nurse said, &quot;You really are amazing. How do you do it?&quot; He
            again said, &quot;You've got to keep the old motor running.&quot;
            The same thing happened the next year. The nurse said, &quot;You
            must be quite a man.&quot; He responded, &quot;You've got to keep
            that old motor running.&quot; The nurse then said, &quot;Well, you
            had better change the oil, this one's black.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A nurse from England was on duty
            in the emergency department, when a punk rocker entered. The patient
            had&nbsp;purple hair, plus a variety of tattoos and strange
            clothing. It was quickly determined that the patient had
            acute&nbsp;appendicitis, so she scheduled for immediate surgery.
            When she was completely disrobed on the operating&nbsp;table, the
            surgeons noticed that her pubic hair had been dyed green, and just
            above it there was a tattoo which&nbsp;read, &quot;Keep off the
            grass.&quot; After the surgical procedure was completed, the surgeon
            added a small note to the dressing which said, &quot;Sorry, had to
            mow the lawn.&quot;</p>

            <p>A young man went up to his father and asked
            him, &quot;Can I have twenty bucks for a blow job?&quot; His father
            said, &quot;I don't know. Are you any good?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A married fellow gets home early from work and
            hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. He rushes upstairs to
            find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. &quot;What's
            up?&quot; he asks. &quot;I'm having a heart attack,&quot; cries the
            woman. He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he's
            dialing, his 4-year-old son comes up and says, &quot;Daddy! Daddy!
            Uncle Ted's hiding in your closet and he's got no clothes on!&quot;
            The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom,
            past his screaming wife, and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure
            enough, there is his brother, totally naked, cowering on the closet
            floor. &quot;You bastard!!!&quot; says the husband. &quot;My wife's
            having a heart attack, and all you can do is run around the house
            naked scaring the kids?&quot;</p>

            <p>A man and a woman who have never met before
            find themselves in the same sleeping carriage of a train. After the
            initial embarrassment they both go to sleep, the man on the top
            bunk, the woman on the lower. In the middle of the night the man
            leans over, wakes the woman and says, &quot;I'm sorry to bother you,
            but I'm awfully cold and I was wondering if you could possibly get
            me another blanket?&quot; The woman leans out and, with a glint in
            her eye, says, &quot; I have a better idea, just for tonight, let's
            make pretend that we're married!&quot; The man says happily,
            &quot;OK!&quot; AWESOME!&quot; The woman says, &quot;GOOD .... Get
            your own fucking blanket!!!</p>

            <p>An 80-year old man was having his annual
            check-up and the doctor asked him how he was feeling. &quot;I've
            never been better!&quot; he boasted. &quot;I've got an eighteen year
            old bride who's pregnant and having my child! What do you think
            about that?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, &quot;Let me
            tell you a story. I knew a guy who was an avid hunter. He never
            missed a season. But one day, he went out in a bit of a hurry, and
            he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of his gun.&quot; The
            doctor continued, &quot;So he was in the woods, and suddenly a
            grizzly bear appeared in front of him! He raised up his umbrella,
            pointed it at the bear and squeezed the handle. And do you know what
            happened?&quot; the doctor queried. Dumbfounded, the old man
            replied, &quot;No.&quot; The doctor continued, &quot;The bear
            dropped dead in front of him!&quot; &quot;That's impossible!&quot;
            exclaimed the old man. &quot;Someone else must have shot that
            bear.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;That's kind of what I'm getting at,&quot; replied the doctor.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man goes to a doctor and says &quot; What
            shall I do? I've just been raped by an elephant!&quot; The doctor
            tells him to bend over so he can have a look at his ass.
            &quot;That's funny!&quot; He says &quot; your asshole is 10 inches
            wide! I thought elephants only had thin long dicks?&quot; The man
            says &quot; Yeah but he fingered me first!&quot;</p>
