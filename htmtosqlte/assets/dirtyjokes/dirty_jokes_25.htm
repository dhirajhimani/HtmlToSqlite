            <p align="left">A salesman knocks at the door of
            a home and it's answered by a 12yr old boy with a cigar in one hand
            and a half empty bottle of scotch in the other. The salesman asks
            the boy, &quot;Excuse me son but is your mom or dad in?&quot; To
            which the boy replies, &quot;Does it fucking look like it?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A woman goes to her doctor,
            complaining that her husband is 300% impotent. The doctor says,
            &quot;I'm not sure I understand what you mean.&quot; She says,
            &quot;Well, the first 100% you can imagine. In addition, he burned
            his tongue and broke his finger!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Did you hear about the fellow
            that was talking to his buddy, and he said, &quot;I don't know what
            to get my wife for her birthday - she has everything, and besides,
            she can afford to buy anything she wants, so I'm stumped.&quot; His
            buddy said, &quot;I have an idea - why don't you make up a
            certificate saying she can have 60 minutes of great sex, any way she
            wants it - she'll probably be thrilled.&quot; So the fellow did. The
            next day his buddy said, &quot;Well? Did you take my
            suggestion?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did,&quot; said the fellow. &quot;Did
            she like it?&quot; His buddy asked. &quot;Oh yes! she jumped up ,
            thanked me, kissed me on the forehead and ran out the door, yelling
            &quot;I'll be back in an hour!!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">There were three guys that won a
            contest. They would get to spend a year in a room with anything they
            chose. The first guy loves to have sex. So they put him in a room
            for a year with over 200 girls to have sex with for a year. The
            second guy loved to get drunk. So they put him in a room with every
            beer there ever was to drink for a year. The third guy loved to
            smoke. So they put him in a room with every kind of cigarette there
            was to smoke. Two hours later they hear the guy that loved to smoke
            banging on the door but they say fuck him, he's in there for a year.<br />
            <br />
            A year later they let them out. They first guy came out and he could
            barely walk, after how many times he had sex. The second guy came
            out and couldn't walk because he was so drunk. The third guy came
            out crying. They asked him why he was banging on the door and why he
            was crying. He said, &quot; I forgot my lighter!&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A mother and her son were flying
            Southwest Airlines from Oakland to Kansas City.<br />
            <br />
            The son, who had been looking out the window, turned to his mother
            and said, &quot;If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby
            cats, why don't big planes have baby planes? The mother, who
            couldn't think of an answer, told her son to ask the flight
            attendant.<br />
            <br />
            So, the little boy asked the flight attendant, &quot;If big dogs
            have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes
            have baby planes?&quot; The flight attendant asked, &quot;Did your
            mother tell you to ask me that?&quot; He said that she had.<br />
            <br />
            With a clever grin, she said, &quot;Tell your mother it's because
            Southwest Airlines always pulls out on time.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">There were 3 gay men and their
            partners all died at around the same time. On their way to the
            morgue, the guy who worked there asked them where they want to
            spread their partners ashes. The first gay guy says, &quot;I want to
            spread his ashes over the ocean because he loved to swim!&quot; The
            second gay guy says, &quot;I want to spread his ashes on a mountain
            because he loved to climb.&quot; And then the third gay guy says,
            &quot;I want to spread him all over my chili, and the guy who worked
            at the morgue asked, &quot;WHY?&quot; and he said,&quot; So he can
            tear my ass up one more time.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">In reaching his plane seat, a man
            is surprised to see a parrot strapped into the seat next to him. The
            man asks the stewardess for a cup of coffee and the parrot squawks,
            &quot;And why don't you get me a whisky you bitch.&quot; The
            stewardess, flustered by the parrot's outburst, brings back a whisky
            for the parrot but inadvertently forgets the man's cup of coffee. As
            the man nicely points out the omission of his coffee to the
            stewardess, the parrot downs his drink and shouts, &quot;And get me
            another whisky you slut.&quot; Visibly shaken, the stewardess comes
            back with the parrot's whisky but still no coffee for the man.
            Unaccustomed to such slackness, the man decides that he is going to
            try the parrots approach, &quot;I've asked you twice for a cup of
            coffee wench, I expect you to get it for me right now or I'm going
            to slap that disgustingly ugly face of yours!&quot; Next thing they
            know, both the man and the parrot are wrenched up and thrown out of
            the emergency exit by 2 burly stewards. Plunging downwards to the
            ground the parrot turns to the man and says, &quot;For someone who
            can't fly, you sure are a lippy bastard... &quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Two homosexual guys were walking
            down the road when one looked at the other and said &quot;You see
            that guy across the road?&quot; &quot;Wow, he's cute!!!&quot; the
            other said. &quot;Well, I had sex with that guy a couple of years
            back.&quot; &quot;No shit???&quot; the other asked. &quot;Not
            much...&quot; replied the first.</p>

            <p align="left">One day Johnny was sitting in
            class and had to go to the bathroom so he raised his hand to ask the
            teachers permission. The teacher told Johnny if he could say the
            alphabet he could go to the bathroom. Johnny stumbled through it and
            got it all wrong and had to hold it. So Johnny studied and studied
            and felt as though he knew the alphabet perfectly. The next day when
            Johnny had to use the bathroom he rose his hand to ask the teacher
            could he go. The teacher said if you can say the alphabet I'll let
            you go. So Johnny started to say the alphabet
            ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOQRSTUVWXYZ. The teacher then asked Johnny well
            where's the P, and Johnny responded it's running down my leg.</p>

            <p align="left">A woman accompanied her husband
            to the doctor's office. After his checkup, the doctor called the
            wife into his office alone. He said, &quot;Your husband is suffering
            from a very severe stress disorder. If you don't do the following,
            your husband will surely die.&quot; &quot;Each morning, fix him a
            healthy breakfast. Be pleasant at all times. For lunch make him a
            nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him.
            Don't burden him with chores. Don't discuss your problems with him,
            it will only make his stress worse. No nagging. And most
            importantly, make love with your husband several times a week. If
            you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your
            husband will regain his health completely.&quot; On the way home,
            the husband asked his wife. &quot;What did the doctor say?&quot; ï¿½He
            said you're going to die,&quot; she replied.</p>

            <p align="left">A young female teacher was giving
            an assignment to her 6th grade class one day. It was a large
            assignment so she started writing high up on the chalkboard.
            Suddenly there was a giggle from one of the boys in the class. She
            quickly turned and asked, &quot;What's so funny, Pat?&quot; &quot;I
            just saw one of your garters!&quot; &quot;Get out of my
            classroom,&quot; she yells, &quot;I don't want to see you for three
            days!&quot; The teacher turns back to the chalkboard. Realizing she
            had forgotten to title the assignment, she reaches to the very top
            of the chalkboard. Suddenly there is an even louder giggle from
            another male student. She quickly turns and asks, &quot;What's so
            funny, Billy?&quot; &quot;I just saw both of your garters!&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">Again, she yells, &quot;Get out
            of my classroom! This time the punishment is more severe, I don't
            want to see you for three weeks!&quot; Embarrassed and frustrated,
            she drops the eraser when she turns around again. So she bends over
            to pick it up. This time there is an burst of laughter from another
            male student. She quickly turns to see Little Johnny leaving the
            classroom. &quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot; she asks.
            &quot;From what I just saw, my school days are over!&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A woman came up behind her
            husband while he was enjoying his morning coffee and slapped him on
            the back of the head. &quot;I found a piece of paper in your pants
            pocket with the name 'Marylou' written on it,&quot; she said,
            furious. &quot;You had better have an explanation.&quot; &quot;Calm
            down, honey,&quot; the man replied. &quot;Remember last week when I
            was at the dog track? That was the name of the dog I bet on.
            &quot;The next morning, his wife snuck up on him and smacked him
            again.&quot; What was that for?&quot; he complained. &quot;Your dog
            called last night.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">One day the first grade teacher
            was reading the story of the Three Little Pigs to her class. She
            came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying to
            accumulate the building materials for his home. She read,
            &quot;...and so the pig went up to the man with the wheel barrow
            full of straw and said, &quot;Pardon me sir, but may I have some of
            that straw to build my house?&quot; The teacher paused then asked
            the class, &quot;And what do you think that man said?&quot; One
            little boy raised his hand and said, &quot;I think he said 'Holy
            Shit! A talking pig!'&quot; The teacher was unable to teach for the
            next 10 minutes.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman was very distraught at the fact that
            she had not had a date or any sex in quite some time. She was afraid
            she might have something wrong with her, so she decided to seek the
            medical expertise of a sex therapist. Her doctor recommended that
            she see a well-known Chinese sex therapist, Dr.Chang, so she went to
            see him. Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang said,
            &quot;OK, take off all you crose.&quot; The woman did as she was
            told. &quot;Now, get down and craw reery, reery fass to odder side
            of room.&quot; Again, the woman did as she was instructed. Dr.Chang
            then said, &quot;OK,now craw reery, reery fass back to me.&quot; So
            she did. Dr. Chang shook his head slowly and said, &quot;Your
            probrem vewy bad. You haf Ed Zachary Disease. Worse case I ever see.
            Dat why you not haf sex or dates.&quot; Worried, the woman asked
            anxiously, &quot;Oh my God, Dr. Chang, what is Ed Zachary
            Disease?&quot; Dr. Chang looked the woman in the eye and replied,
            &quot;Ed Zachary Disease is when your face rook Ed Zachary rike your
            ass.&quot;</p>

            <p>On hearing that her elderly grandfather had
            died, Jenny went straight to visit her grandmother. When she asked
            how her grandpa had died, her grandma explained, not holding back
            anything of course, &quot;He had a heart attack during sex, Sunday
            morning!&quot; Horrified, Jenny suggested that screwing at the age
            of 94 was surely asking for trouble! &quot;Oh no,&quot; her grandma
            replied. &quot;We had sex every Sunday morning in time with the
            church bells!&quot; &quot;In with the dings, out with the
            dongs!&quot; She paused to wipe away a tear, &quot;If it wasn't for
            that damn Ice Cream Truck, he'd still be alive!!!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A hippy walks into a Bar and Grill. The waiter
            comes up to him and asks him if he wants anything. So the Hippy says
            'Yeah a cheeseburger. Not too well done, not to rare, but right in
            the groove.' So the waiter brings his burger and asks if he wants
            anything to drink. He says 'A cup of tea. Not too hot, not too cold,
            but right in the Groove.' The waiter's kinda getting pissed now, but
            he brings the tea and kinda slams it on the table. Little while
            later the waiter comes back and asks the Hippy if he wants any
            dessert. He says 'Yeah some ice cream. Not too chocolate, not too
            vanilla, but right in the Groove.' So the waiter says 'Why don't you
            kiss my ass. Not the right cheek, not the left cheek, but right in
            the Groove!'</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The Madam opened the brothel door to see a
            frail, elderly gentleman.. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; the madam
            asked. &quot;I want Natalie,&quot; the old man replied. &quot;Sir,
            Natalie is one of our most expensive ladies, perhaps someone
            else...&quot; &quot;No, I must see Natalie.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Just then Natalie appeared and announced to the old man that she
            charges $1,000 per visit. Without blinking, the man reached into his
            pocket and handed her ten $100 bills. The two went up to a room for
            an hour,&nbsp; whereupon the man calmly left..<br />
            <br />
            The next night he appeared again demanding to see Natalie.
            Natalie&nbsp; explained that no one had ever come back two nights in
            a row and that There were no discounts...it was still $1,000 a
            visit. Again the old man&nbsp; took out the money, the two went up
            to the room and an hour later, he left.<br />
            <br />
            When he showed up the third consecutive night, no one could believe
            it. Again he handed Natalie the money and up to the room they went.
            At the end of the hour Natalie questioned the old man: &quot;No one
            has ever used my services three nights in a row. Where are you
            from?&quot; The old man replied, &quot;I'm from Philadelphia.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Really?&quot; replied Natalie. &quot;I have family who lives
            there.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said the old man. &quot;Your father died,
            and I'm your sister's attorney. She asked me to give this $3,000 to
            you.&quot; (Some things in life are certain: taxes, death and being
            screwed by an attorney.)</p>
