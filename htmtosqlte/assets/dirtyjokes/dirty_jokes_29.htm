            <p>A young couple, on the brink of 
            divorce, visits a marriage counsellor. The counsellor asks the wife, 
            &quot;What�s the problem?&quot; She responds, &quot;My husband suffers from 
            premature ejaculation.&quot; The counsellor turns to her husband and 
            inquires, &quot;Is that true?&quot; The husband replies, &quot;Well not exactly, 
            she's the one that suffers, not me.&quot;</p>

            <p>An elderly man goes into a brothel 
            and tells the madam he would like a young girl for the night. 
            Surprised, she looks at the ancient man and asks how old he is. &quot;I'm 
            90 years old,&quot; he says. &quot;90!&quot; replies the woman. &quot;Don't you realize 
            you've had it?&quot; &quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; says the old man, &quot;how much do I owe 
            you?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>&quot;I can't find a cause for your 
            illness,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;Frankly, I think it's due to drinking.&quot; 
            &quot;In that case,&quot; replied his patient, &quot;I'll come back when you are 
            sober.&quot;</p>

            <p>After 40 years as a gynaecologist, 
            John decided he had enough money to retire and take up his real 
            love, auto mechanics. He left his practice, enrolled in auto 
            mechanics school, and studied hard. The day of the final exam came 
            and John worried if he would be able to complete the test with the 
            same proficiency as his younger classmates. Most of the students 
            completed their exam in two hours. John, on the other hand, took the 
            entire four hours allotted. The following day, John was delighted 
            and surprised to see a score of 150% for his exam. John spoke to his 
            professor after class. &quot;I never dreamed I could do this well on the 
            exam. How did I earn a score of 150%?&quot; The professor replied, &quot;I 
            gave you 50% for perfectly disassembling the car engine. I awarded 
            another 50% for perfectly reassembling the engine. I gave you an 
            additional 50% for having done all of it through the muffler.&quot;</p>

            <p>Two young boys walked into a pharmacy 
            one day, picked out a box of Tampax and proceeded to the checkout 
            counter. The man at the counter asked the older boy, &quot;Son, how old 
            are you?&quot; &quot;Eight,&quot; the boy replied. The man continued, &quot;Do you know 
            how these are used?&quot; The boy replied, &quot;Not exactly, but they aren't 
            for me. They are for my brother�he's four. We saw on TV that if you 
            use these you would be able to swim and ride a bike. He can't do 
            either one.&quot;</p>

            <p>The ambitious coach of a girls track 
            team gives the squad steroids. The team�s performance soars. They 
            win the county and state championship until one day they are 
            favoured 
            to win nationals easily. Penelope, a 16-year-old hurdler visits her 
            coach and says, &quot;Coach, I have a problem. Hair is starting to grow 
            on my chest.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; the coach says in a panic, &quot;How far down does 
            it go?&quot; She replies, &quot;Down to my testicles. That's something else I 
            want to talk to you about.&quot;</p>

            <p>In a mental institution a nurse walks 
            into a room and sees a patient acting like he's driving a car. The 
            nurse asks him, &quot;Charlie, what are you doing?&quot; Charlie replied, 
            &quot;Driving to Chicago!&quot; The nurse wishes him a good trip and leaves 
            the room. The next day the nurse enters Charlie's room just as he 
            stops driving his imaginary car and asks, &quot;Well Charlie, how are you 
            doing?&quot; Charlie says, &quot;I just got into Chicago.&quot; &quot;Great,&quot; replied 
            the nurse. The nurse leaves Charlie's room and goes across the hall 
            into Bob's room, and finds Bob sitting on his bed furiously 
            pleasuring himself. Shocked, she asks, &quot;Bob, what are you doing?&quot; 
            Bob says, &quot;I'm screwing Charlie's wife while he's in Chicago!&quot;</p>

            <p>The artist tried to concentrate on 
            his work, but the attraction he felt for his model finally became 
            irresistible. He threw down his palette, took her in his arms, and 
            kissed her. She pushed him away. &quot;Maybe your other models let you 
            kiss them,&quot; she said, &quot;but I'm not that kind!&quot; &quot;Actually, I've never 
            tried to kiss a model before,&quot; he protested. &quot;Really?&quot; she said, 
            softening. &quot;Well, how many models have there been?&quot; &quot;Four so far,&quot; 
            he replied, thinking back. &quot;A jug, two apples and a vase.&quot;</p>

            <p>Bill and Marla decided the only way to pull 
            off a Sunday afternoon quickie with their ten-year-old son in the 
            apartment was to send him out on the balcony and order him to report 
            on all the neighbourhood activities. The boy began his commentary as 
            his parents put their plan into operation. &quot;There's a car being 
            towed from the parking lot,&quot; he said. &quot;An ambulance just drove by.&quot; 
            A few moments passed. &quot;Looks like the Andersons have company,&quot; he 
            called out. &quot;Matt's riding a new bike and the Coopers are making 
            love.&quot; Mom and Dad bolted upright in bed. &quot;How do you know that?&quot; 
            the startled father asked. &quot;Their kid is standing out on the 
            balcony, too,&quot; his son replied.</p>

            <p>A man returned home from the night 
            shift and went straight up to the bedroom. He found his wife with 
            the sheet pulled over her head, fast asleep. Not to be denied, the 
            horny husband crawled under the sheet and proceeded to make love to 
            her. Afterward, he hurried downstairs for something to eat and was 
            startled to find breakfast on the table and his wife pouring coffee. 
            &quot;How'd you get down here so fast?&quot; he asked. &quot;We were just making 
            love!&quot; &quot;Oh my God,&quot; his wife gasped, &quot;That's my mother up there! She 
            came over and complained of having a headache. I told her to lie 
            down for awhile.&quot; Rushing upstairs, the wife ran to the bedroom. 
            &quot;Mother, I can't believe this happened. Why didn't you say 
            something?&quot; The mother-in-law huffed, &quot;I haven't spoken to that jerk 
            for 15 years and I wasn't about to start now!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The limousine was taking the beautiful, 
            raven-haired model to the airport. Halfway there, the front tire 
            went flat. The model said, &quot;Driver, I don't have time to wait for 
            road service. Can you change it yourself?&quot; The driver said, &quot;Sure.&quot; 
            He got out of the car and proceeded to change the tire, but couldn't 
            get the wheel cover off. The model saw him struggling and asked, &quot;Do 
            you want a screwdriver?&quot; He said &quot;Sure! But, first I have to change 
            this tire.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman awakes during the night, and her 
            husband isn�t in bed with her. She goes downstairs to look for him. 
            She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in 
            front of him. He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the 
            wall. She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of 
            his coffee. &quot;What's the matter, dear?&quot; she asks. &quot;Why are you down 
            here at this time of night?&quot; The husband looks up from his coffee, 
            &quot;Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only 
            16?&quot; he asks solemnly. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; she replies. &quot;Do you remember 
            when your father caught us in the back seat of my car making love?&quot; 
            &quot;Yes, I remember,&quot; says the wife, lowering herself into a chair 
            beside him. The husband continues, &quot;Do you remember when he shoved 
            the shotgun in my face and said, 'Either you marry my daughter, or 
            I'll send you to jail for 20 years?�&quot; &quot;I remember that, too,&quot; she 
            replies softly. He wipes another tear from his cheek and says, &quot;I 
            would have gotten out today.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man and woman are at a bar having a few 
            beers. They start talking and soon realize they're both doctors. 
            After an hour, the man says, &quot;Hey, how about if we sleep together 
            tonight? No strings attached.&quot; The woman doctor agrees to it. They 
            go back to her place and he goes in the bedroom. She goes into the 
            bathroom and starts scrubbing up like she's about to go into the 
            operating room. She scrubs for a good 10 minutes. At last, she goes 
            into the bedroom and they have sex. Afterward, the man says, &quot;You're 
            a surgeon, aren't you?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the woman, &quot;how did you know?&quot; 
            &quot;I could tell by the way you scrubbed up before we started,&quot; he 
            says. &quot;That makes sense,&quot; says the woman. &quot;You're an 
            anaesthesiologist, aren't you?&quot; &quot;Yeah, how did you know?&quot; asks the 
            man. The woman replies, &quot;Because I didn't feel a thing.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man was just waking up from anaesthesia after 
            surgery, and his wife was sitting by his side. His eyes fluttered 
            open and he said, &quot;You're beautiful.&quot; Then he fell asleep again. His 
            wife had never heard him say that, so she stayed by his side. A few 
            minutes later, his eyes fluttered open and he said, &quot;You're cute!&quot; 
            The wife was disappointed because instead of &quot;beautiful,&quot; it was now 
            &quot;cute.&quot; She said, &quot;What happened to 'beautiful'?&quot; The man replied, 
            &quot;The drugs are wearing off!&quot; </p>
