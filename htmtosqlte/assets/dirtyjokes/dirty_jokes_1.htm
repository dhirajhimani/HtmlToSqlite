            <p align="left">A man and his wife go to their
            honeymoon hotel for their 25th anniversary. As the couple reflected
            on that magical evening 25 years ago, the wife asked the husband,
            &quot;When you first saw my naked body in front of you, what was
            going through your mind?&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">The husband replied, &quot;All I
            wanted to do was to fuck your brains out, and suck your tits
            dry.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">Then, as the wife undressed, she
            asked, &quot;What are you thinking now?&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">He replied, &quot;It looks as if
            I did a pretty good job.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">As an airplane is about to crash,
            a female passenger jumps up frantically and announces, &quot;If I'm
            going to die, I want to die feeling like a woman.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">She removes all her clothing and
            asks, &quot;Is there someone on this plane who is man enough to make
            me feel like a woman?&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">A man stands up, removes his
            shirt and says, &quot;Here, iron this!&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p align="left">One morning a woman was walking
            out of her front door, when she notices a strange little man at the
            bottom of her garden.</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;You're a goblin,&quot; she
            says, &quot;I caught you and you owe me three wishes!&quot;. So the
            goblin replies &quot;OK, you caught me fair and square, what's your
            first wish?&quot;. The woman stops and thinks for a second, &quot;I
            want a huge mansion to live in.&quot;, goblins replies &quot;OK,
            you've got it.&quot;. Woman again thinks it over, &quot;My second
            wish is a Mercedes.&quot; &quot;OK, you've got that too.&quot;
            &quot;My last wish is a million dollars!&quot;. The goblin then says
            &quot;OK, you've got it. But to make your wishes come true you have
            to have sex all night with me.&quot; &quot;OK then, if that's what
            it takes...&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">Next morning the little man wakes
            the woman up.</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;Tell me,&quot; says the
            man, &quot;how old are you?&quot; &quot;I'm 27&quot;, she replies</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;Fuck me&quot;, says the

            trousers and throw them at her. He says, &quot;Put those on.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">The bride replies, &quot;I can't
            wear your trousers.&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">He replies, &quot;And don't
            forget that! I will always wear the pants in the family!&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">The bride takes off her knickers
            and throws them at him with the same request, &quot;Try those
            on!&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">He replies,&quot;I can't get into
            your knickers!&quot;</p>

            <p>There was an elderly man who wanted to make
            his younger wife pregnant. So, he went to the doctor to have a sperm
            count done. The doctor told him to take a specimen cup home, fill
            it, and bring it back the next day. The elderly man came back the
            next day and the specimen cup was empty and the lid was on it.
            Doctor: What was the problem? Elderly man: Well, you I tried with my
            right hand...nothing. So, I tried with my left hand...nothing. My
            wife tried with her right hand...nothing. Her left hand...nothing.
            Her mouth...nothing. Then my wife's friend tried. Right hand, left
            hand, mouth....still nothing. Doctor: Wait a minute. You mean your
            wife's friend too?! Elderly man: Yeah, and we still couldn't get the
            lid off of the specimen cup.</p>

            <p>A guy walks into a sperm donor bank wearing a
            ski mask and holding a gun. He goes up to the nurse and demands her
            to open the sperm bank vault. She says &quot;But sir, its just a
            sperm bank!&quot;, &quot;I don't care, open it now!!!&quot; he
            replies. So she opens the door to the vault and inside are all the
            sperm samples. The guy says &quot;Take one of those sperm samples
            and drink it!&quot;, she looks at him &quot;BUT, they are sperm
            samples???&quot; , &quot;DO IT!&quot;. So the nurse sucks it back.
            &quot;That one there, drink that one as well.&quot;, so the nurse
            drinks that one as well. Finally after 4 samples the man takes off
            his ski mask and says, &quot;See honey - its not that hard.&quot;</p>

            break the ice, and to get the therapy started, John decides to ask a
            show of hands how often the attendees had sex. He first asks for a
            show of hands of all the people who had sex almost every night. A
            modest number of hands were raised. He then asks, how many had sex
            once a week? This time a larger number of hands were raised. John
            then asks how many had sex once or twice a month? Again a few hands
            were raised. After John polled his group several more times he
            noticed one guy sitting off to the side with this huge beaming grin
            on his face. John noticed that the guy never raised his hand, so he
            asked him how often he had sex. The guy said, �Once a year!� To
            John's dismay, he responds, �Why are you so happy getting sex only
            once a year?� The grinning guy responds, &quot;Tonight�s the
