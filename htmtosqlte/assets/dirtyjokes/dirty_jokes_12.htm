            <hr />
            <p>A couple was invited to a swanky masked
            Halloween Party. She got a terrible headache and told her husband to
            go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but
            she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to
            bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not
            going. So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after
            sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was
            still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her
            husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would
            have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she
            was not with him.<br />
            <br />
            She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around
            on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could and
            copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife up to
            him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner
            high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just
            arrived.<br />
            <br />
            She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her
            husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and
            she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had a little
            bang. Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went
            home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind
            of explanation he would make for his behavior.<br />
            <br />
            She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a
            time he had had. He said, &quot;Oh the same old thing. You know I
            never have a good time when you're not there.&quot; The she asked,
            &quot;Did you dance much?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            He replied, &quot;I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When
            I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went
            into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you... the
            guy I loaned my costume to, sure had a real good time!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>An escaped convict broke into a house and tied
            up a young couple who had been sleeping in the bedroom. As soon as
            he had a chance, the husband turned to his voluptuous young wife,
            bound up on the bed in a skimpy nightgown, and whispered, 'Honey,
            this guy hasn't seen a woman in years. Just cooperate with anything
            he wants. If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it
            and pretend you like it. Our lives depend on it.'<br />
            <br />
            'Dear,' the wife hissed, spitting out her gag, 'I'm so relieved you
            feel that way, because he just told me he thinks you have a really
            nice, tight-looking ass!!!!!!!'</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A cop saw a car weaving all over the road and
            pulled it over. He walked up to the car and saw a nice-looking woman
            behind the wheel. There was a strong smell liquor on her breath.<br />
            <br />
            He said, 'I'm going to give you a breathalyzer test to determine if
            you are under the influence of alcohol.' She blew up the balloon and
            he walked it back to the police car. After a couple of minutes, he
            returned to her car and said, 'It looks like you've had a couple of
            stiff ones.'<br />
            <br />
            She replied, 'You mean it shows that, too?'</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was a man who wanted a pure wife. So he
            started to attend church to find a woman. He met a gal who&nbsp;
            seemed nice so he took her home. When they got there, he whips out
            his manhood and asks &quot;What's this?&quot; She replies &quot;A
            cock.&quot; He thinks to himself that she is not pure enough.<br />
            <br />
            A couple of weeks later he meets another gal and soon takes her
            home. Again, he pulls out his manhood and asks the question. She
            replies &quot;A cock&quot;. He is pissed because she seemed more
            pure than the first but oh well.<br />
            <br />
            A couple of weeks later he meets a gal who seems real pure. She
            won't go home with him for a long time but eventually he gets her to
            his house. He whips it out and asks, &quot;What is this?&quot; She
            giggles and says &quot;A pee-pee&quot; He thinks to himself that he
            has finally found his woman.<br />
            <br />
            They get married but after several months every time she sees his
            member she giggles and says &quot;That's your pee-pee.&quot; He
            finally breaks down and says &quot;Look this is not a pee-pee, it is
            a cock.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            She laughs and says &quot;No it's not, a cock is ten inches long and
            black.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two girls were discussing their heavy smoking
            habits. &quot;I get such a yen for a cigarette,&quot; said one,
            &quot;that the only effective countermeasure is to pop a Life Saver
            into my mouth and suck hard.&quot; &quot;That's fine for you,&quot;
            huffed her friend, &quot;but I don't happen to live in a house
            that's right on the beach!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was an exhibitionist who was taking a
            trip on an airplane. At the top of the stairs there was a stewardess
            who was collecting tickets. So when the man got to the top of the
            stairs, he opened his coat and exposed himself. The stewardess said,
            &quot;I'm sorry sir. You have to show your ticket here, not your
            stub.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man got a job in the sales promotion
            department of a cola soft-drink company. When he asked about
            his&nbsp; duties, the manager explained. &quot;Oh! It's an easy job!
            All you have to is call on ten women buyers every day, and knock
            Seven-Up!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This woman goes into a dentist's office, after
            he is through examining her he says: &quot;I am sorry to tell you
            this, but I am going to have to drill a tooth.&quot; The woman then
            says: &quot;Ooooohhhh, the pain is so awful I'd rather have a
            baby!&quot; To which the dentist replies, &quot;Make up your mind, I
            have to adjust the chair.&quot;</p>

            <p>Tarzan had been living alone in his jungle
            kingdom for 30 years with only apes for company, and suitably shaped
            holes in trees for sex. Jane, a reporter, came to Africa in search
            of this legendary figure. Deep in the wilds she came to a clearing
            and discovered Tarzan vigorously thrusting into a jungle oak. She
            watched in awe for a while.</p>
            <p>Finally, overcome by this display of animal
            passion Jane came out into the open and offered herself to him. As
            she reclined on the wild grass Tarzan ran up to her and gave her a
            big kick in the crotch. In pain she screamed 'What the hell did you
            do that for?' Tarzan replied, 'Always check for squirrels.'</p>

            <p>A male whale and a female whale were swimming
            off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male
            whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father
            many years earlier. He said to the female whale, &quot;Lets both
            swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time
            and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. They tried it
            and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon
            however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and
            were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they
            were going to get away and told the female &quot;lets swim after
            them and gobble them up before they reach the shore.&quot; At this
            point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.
            &quot;Look&quot;, she said, &quot;I went along with the blow job,
            but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.&quot;</p>

            <p>Bruce comes home one day and says to his
            lover, &quot;Please do me a favor. It feels like something's stuck
            up my ass. Could you check it out for me?&quot; His roommate lubes
            up his finger (mercifully) and shoves it up Bruce's ass, feeling all
            around, and says, &quot;I don't feel anything.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Bruce says, &quot;Trust me, there's something up there. Try lubing
            up your whole hand and checking it out.&quot; So his roommate lubes
            his whole hand and sticks it up Bruce's ass. He feels around, and
            then pulls out a Rolex watch.<br />
            <br />
            He says, &quot;I found your problem. There was a watch stuck up your
            ass.&quot; Bruce starts singing, &quot;Happy birthday to you, happy
            birthday to you...&quot;</p>

            <p>Ol' Fred had been a faithful Christian and was
            in the hospital, near death. The family called their pastor to stand
            with them. As the pastor stood next to the bed, Ol' Fred's condition
            appeared to deteriorate and he motioned frantically for something to
            write on. The pastor lovingly handed him a pen and a piece of paper,
            and Ol' Fred used his last bit of energy to scribble a note, then he
            died. The pastor thought it best not to look at the note at that<br />
            time, so he placed it in his jacket pocket.<br />
            <br />
            At the funeral, as he was finishing the message, he realized that he
            was wearing the same jacket that he was wearing when Ol' Fred died.
            He said, &quot;You know, Ol' Fred handed me a note just before he
            died. I haven't looked at it, but knowing Fred, I'm sure there's a
            word of inspiration there for us all.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            He opened the note, and read, &quot;Asshole, you're standing on my
            oxygen tube!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The first grade teacher was starting a new
            lesson on multi-syllable words. She thought it would be a good idea
            to ask a few of the children examples of words with more than one
            syllable. &quot;Jane, Do you know any multi-syllable words?&quot;
            After some thought Jane proudly replied with Monday. &quot;Great
            Jane. That has two syllables, Mon......day. Does anyone know another
            word?&quot; Johnny from the back of the room yells, &quot;I do! I
            do!&quot; Knowing Johnny's more mature sense of humor she picks Mike
            instead. &quot;OK Mike, what is your word.&quot; Saturday says Mike.
            &quot;Great, that has three syllables...&quot; Not wanting to be
            outdone Johnny says &quot;I know a four syllable word. Pick me! Pick
            me!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Not thinking he can do any harm with a word that large the teacher
            reluctantly says, &quot;O.K. Johnny what is your four syllable
            word?&quot; Johnny proudly says, &quot;Mas...tur...ba...tion.&quot;
            Shocked, the teacher, trying to retain her composure says,
            &quot;Wow, Johnny. Four syllables! That's certainly is a
            mouthful.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;No Ma'am, your thinking of 'blowjob', and that's only two
            syllables.&quot;</p>
