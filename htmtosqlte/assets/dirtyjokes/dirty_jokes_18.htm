            <p>While in the playground with his friend,
            Little Johnny noticed that Jimmy was wearing a brand new, shiny
            watch. &quot;Did you get that for your birthday?&quot; asked Little
            Johnny. &quot;Nope.&quot; replied Jimmy. &quot;Well, did you get it
            for Christmas then?&quot;. Again Jimmy says &quot;Nope.&quot;
            &quot;You didn't steal it, did you?&quot; asks Little Johnny.
            &quot;No,&quot; said Jimmy. &quot;I went into Mom and Dad's bedroom
            the other night when they were 'doing the nasty'. Dad gave me his
            watch to get rid of me.<br />
            <br />
            Little Johnny was extremely impressed with this idea, and extremely
            jealous of Jimmy's new watch. He vowed to get one for himself. That
            night, he waited outside his parents' bedroom until he heard the
            unmistakable noises of<br />
            lovemaking. Just then, he swung the door wide open and boldly strode
            into the bedroom. His father, caught in mid stroke, turned and said
            angrily. &quot;What do you want now?&quot; &quot;I wanna
            watch,&quot; Johnny replied.<br />
            <br />
            Without missing a stroke, his father said, &quot;Fine. Stand in the
            corner and watch, but keep quiet.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Doctor: &quot;Your wife either
            has Alzheimer's or AIDS.&quot; Husband: &quot;How can we find out
            which?&quot; Doctor: &quot;I need you to run a little experiment
            this weekend. Take your wife to a park and leave her there. If she
            finds her way home; don't fuck her.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Two pedophiles were walking down
            the street one day when they came across a pair of small lacey
            knickers on the ground. The first one picks them up, smells them and
            goes, &quot;Aahhh... A seven-year-old girl.&quot; The other grabs
            them from him and also takes a smell and goes, &quot;No, no ...
            Definitely an eight-year-old girl!&quot; The two of them are them
            smelling them in turns and arguing. &quot;An eight-year-old!&quot;,
            &quot;No, a seven-year-old!&quot;, &quot;Definitely an
            eight-year-old!&quot; .... and so on. The local priest is walking
            past as the two men argue and can't help but ask them what the
            commotion is all about.<br />
            <br />
            The first pedophile tells the priest, and asks him if he could sort
            out the argument, so the priest takes the knickers, has a good long
            sniff, and after pondering for a few moments he looks at the two men
            and says: &quot;Definitely an eight-year-old girl! ......... but not
            from my parish!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">During his monthly visit to the
            corner barbershop, this fellow asked his barber for any suggestions
            on how to treat his increasing baldness. After a brief pause, the
            barber leaned over and confided that the best thing he'd come across
            was, er, female juices. &quot;But you're balder than I am,&quot;
            protested the customer. &quot;True,&quot; admitted the barber,
            &quot;but you've gotta admit I've got one hell of a mustache!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The rescue team finds the crashed airplane.
            The lone survivor is chewing on a bone, with a huge pile of human
            bones next to him, and the rescuers are shocked. He says, &quot;You
            can't judge me for this. I had to survive.&quot; The leader of the
            rescue team says, &quot;But Jesus Christ, man... your plane only
            went down yesterday.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Three mice are sitting in a bar in a pretty
            rough neighborhood late at night trying to impress each other about
            how tough they are. The first mouse slams a shot of scotch, and
            pounds the shot glass to the bar, turns to the second mouse and
            says: &quot;When I see a mousetrap, I get on it, lie on my back, and
            set it off with my foot. When the bar comes down, I catch it in my
            teeth, and then bench press it 100 times.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The second mouse orders up two shots of tequila. He grabs one in
            each paw, slams the shots, and pounds the glasses to the bar. He
            turns to the other mice and replies: &quot;Yeah, well when I see rat
            poison, I collect as much as I can and take it home. In the morning,
            I grind it up into a powder and put it in my coffee so I get a good
            buzz going for the rest of the day.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The first mouse and the second mouse then turn to the third mouse.
            The third mouse lets out a long sigh and says to the first two,
            &quot;I don't have time for this bullshit. I gotta go home and fuck
            the cat.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A little dwarf lady goes into her doctor's
            office complaining of an irritated crotch. After an examination, the
            doctor sighs, &quot;I don't seem to see any problem. Does it get
            better or worse at any time?&quot; &quot;Yeah, it's really bad
            whenever it rains,&quot; she replies. &quot;Well, then,&quot; says
            the Doc, &quot;Next time it rains, get in here at once, and we'll
            take another look at it.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Two weeks later, it's raining really hard, and the little lady shows
            up at the doctor's office. &quot;Doctor, it's really bad today.
            Please, you have to help me!!&quot; &quot;Well, let's have a
            look,&quot; he says, as he lifts her up onto the table. &quot;Oh,
            yes, I think I see the problem. Nurse, bring me a surgical kit.
            Don't worry ma'am, this won't hurt a bit.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The dwarf lady closes her eyes in painful anticipation. The doctor
            begins snipping away and finishes a few minutes later. &quot;There
            you go, ma'am, try that.&quot; She walks back and forth around the
            office and exclaims, &quot;That's great, Doc, what did you do?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I just took a couple of inches off the top of your rain
            boots.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">If you think life is bad... How
            would you like to be an egg? You only get laid once. You only get
            eaten once. It takes 4 minutes to get hard. Only 2 minutes to get
            soft. You share your box with 11 other guys. But worst of all. The
            only chick that ever sat on your face was your mother. So cheer
            up... Your life ain't that bad!</p>

            <p align="left">A pirate walks off his ship. He
            has a wooden leg, a hook for a hand, and a patch over his right eye.
            He sits down on a bench, and begins throwing peanuts to the
            seagulls. Two curious young children shyly sit down next to him and
            ask the pirate how he came to have a wooden leg.<br />
            <br />
            The pirate replies, &quot;Well, I was standing on the deck of me
            ship one day, and a wave washed me overboard. Then, a hungry shark
            attacked me and bit me leg off.&quot; The little boy then asks,
            &quot;How did you lose your hand?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Many years ago, I was fighting the Navy, and one of them boys
            cut me hand off. Me doc couldn't find a hand, so he gave me this
            hook.&quot; Next, the little girl asks, &quot;How did you lose your
            eye?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Well, I was standing watch up in the crow's nest, and just as
            I looked up, a lousy seagull flew over and did his business right in
            me eye.&quot; The children, now thoroughly confused, ask, &quot;How
            did that cause you to lose your eye?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The pirate explains, &quot;Well, it was me first day with the
            hook.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young lady came home from a date, rather
            sad. She told her mother, &quot;Anthony proposed to me an hour
            ago.&quot; &quot;Then why are you so sad?&quot; her mother asked.
            &quot;Because he also told me he is an atheist. Mom, he doesn't even
            believe there's a Hell.&quot; Her mother replied, &quot;Marry him
            anyway. Between the two of us, we'll show him how wrong he is.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A city boy wanted to marry a
            country girl. She insists that he has to ask her father for her hand
            in marriage. So off he goes to their farm to ask her father. &quot;I
            want to marry your daughter&quot;. &quot;Well, my boy you will have
            to prove to me that you are a man worthy of my daughter.&quot;
            &quot;I'll do anything for my love&quot; says the young man.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;You see that cow out in the pasture? Well go screw it.&quot; A
            little puzzled the boy says, &quot;OK, anything for my love&quot; On
            his return of doing his deed, he asks, &quot;Now can I marry your
            daughter?&quot; &quot;Nope.&quot; says the father, &quot;See that
            goat over yonder? Well, Go screw it.&quot; Again the boy obliges and
            returns saying, &quot;Now can I marry your daughter?&quot;
            &quot;Nope. Not yet -- one more thing. See that pig in the sty? Well
            go to it.&quot; Once again he obliges and returns. This time the
            farmer is amazed at seeing this boy doing these deeds just to marry
            his daughter.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            So the father finally tells the boy, &quot;Now you can marry my
            daughter.&quot; To which the boy replies, &quot;SCREW YOUR DAUGHTER,
            HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR THAT PIG?&quot;&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="left">A little boy gets up to go to the
            bathroom in the middle of the night. As he passes his parent's
            bedroom he peeks in through the keyhole. He watches for a moment,
            then continues on down the hallway, saying to himself, &quot;Boy,
            and she gets mad at me for sucking my thumb&quot;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Queen was showing the Archbishop of
            Canterbury around the royal stable, when one of the stallions close
            by farted so loudly it couldn't be ignored. &quot;Oh dear,&quot;
            said the Queen, &quot;How embarrassing. I'm frightfully sorry about
            that.&quot; &quot;It's quite understandable,&quot; said the
            Archbishop, and after a moment, added, &quot;as a matter of fact I
            thought it was the horse.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A husband and wife go visit a marriage
            counselor. First, the wife speaks to the counselor alone. The
            counselor asks, &quot;You say you've been married 20 years, so what
            seems to be the problem?&quot; The wife replies, &quot;It's my
            husband -- he's driving me crazy! I'm going to leave him if he
            continues!&quot; &quot;How does he drive you crazy?&quot; &quot;For
            20 years,&quot; she says, &quot;he's been doing these stupid things.
            First, whenever we go out, he's always looking at the floor and
            refuses to go near anyone. It's very embarrassing.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The marriage counselor is amused, &quot;Anything else?&quot;
            &quot;He keeps picking his nose all the time! Even in public!&quot;
            &quot;Hmm, anything else?&quot; probes the counselor further. The
            wife hesitates, &quot;whenever we're making love, he NEVER lets me
            be on top! Once in a while, I'd like to be in control!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Ah,&quot; says the counselor, &quot;I think I'll talk to your
            husband now.&quot; So the wife goes out of the room and the husband
            enters. The counselor tells him, &quot;Your wife says that you've
            been driving her crazy. She might even leave you.&quot; The husband
            looks shocked, &quot;WHAT? For 20 years I've been loving and
            considerate and I've always given her what she wants! What could be
            the problem?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The counselor explains, &quot;She says that you've got these habits
            that are driving her crazy. First, you're always acting strange in
            public--looking at the floor and never going near anyone else.&quot;
            The husband looks concerned, &quot;Oh, you don't understand! It's
            one of the few things my father told me to do in his deathbed and I
            swore I'd obey everything he said.&quot; &quot;What did he
            say?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;He said that I should never step on anyone's toes!&quot; The
            counselor looks amused, &quot;Actually, that means that you should
            not do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry.&quot; The
            husband looks sheepish, &quot;Oh. Okay.&quot; The counselor
            continues, &quot;And you keep picking your nose in public.&quot;
            &quot;Well, its another thing my father specifically commanded me to
            do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The counselor looks faint, &quot;That means that you should not
            indulge in any criminal activity.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says the
            husband looking very stupid. &quot;And finally, she says that you
            never allow her to be on top during your lovemaking.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;This,&quot; says the husband seriously, &quot;is the last
            thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed and it's the most
            important thing.&quot; &quot;What did he say?&quot; The husband
            replies, &quot;In his dying breath, he said. Don't screw up.&quot;</p>
