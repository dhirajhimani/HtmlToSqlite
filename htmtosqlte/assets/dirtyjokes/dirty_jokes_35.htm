      <p>A man went to pick up his date but he was having 
      some trouble with his flatulence system, in other words he couldn't stop 
      farting so when he had to wait for the young woman to get ready for the 
      date he sat on the lounge and let out just a little fart when the dog 
      hopped onto the couch with him. He figured that the parents would think it 
      was the dog. Every time he farted the young girl's parents told the dog to 
      get off the couch and so the man kept going, finally he let rip and the 
      parents finally told the dog to get off the couch before the man shit on 
      him!</p>

            <p>A man goes to a shrink and says, &quot;Doctor, my wife is 
      unfaithful to me. Every evening, she goes to Larry's bar and picks up men. 
      In fact, She sleeps with anybody who asks her! I'm going crazy. What do 
      you think I should do?&quot; &quot;Relax,&quot; says the Doctor, &quot;take a deep breath and 
      calm down. Now, tell me, exactly where is Larry's bar?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The couple had been married for twenty years. It was 
		a happy, wonderful marriage, except that the wife was very unfaithful. 
		The husband finally got so tired of her unfaithfulness that he made her 
		promise to never again be untrue to him. One day he came home and found 
		her in bed with a midget. He cried out, &quot;My wife, my love, after you 
		made all those promises, I find you in bed with another man, and a 
		midget at that!&quot; She replied, &quot;My dearest husband, the love of my life, 
		do you not believe me, do you not see, do you not understand? I am 
		tapering off.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
      <p>Two men are sitting in the doctor's office. The one 
		looks at the other one and says, &quot;What are you here for?&quot; The man 
		replied &quot;I have a red ring around my pecker, What are you here for?&quot; The 
		other man said, &quot;I have a green ring around my pecker.&quot; The doctor 
		called the man with the red ring first in his office and examined him. 
		As he was walking out he told the other guy it was no problem. The 
		doctor called the man in with the green ring around his pecker and 
		examined him. The doctor says, &quot;Your pecker is gonna fall off and you 
		are gonna die&quot;. The mans says, &quot;What?? You told the man with the red 
		ring he was ok, but I'm gonna die??&quot; The doctor said, &quot;Yes but there's a 
		lot of difference lipstick and gangrene!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Three Italian nuns die and go to heaven. At the 
		Pearly Gates, they are met by St. Peter. He says &quot;Sisters, you all led 
		such wonderful lives that I'm granting you six months to go back to 
		earth and be anyone you want to be.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The first nun says, &quot;I want to be Sophia Loren;&quot; and *poof* she's gone.<br />
		<br />
		The second says, &quot;I want to be Madonna;&quot; and *poof* she's gone.<br />
		<br />
		The third says, &quot;I want to be Sara Pipalini.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		St. Peter looks perplexed. &quot;Who?&quot; he says.<br />
		<br />
		&quot;Sara Pipalini;&quot; replies the nun.<br />
		<br />
		St. Peter shakes his head and says; &quot;I'm sorry, but that name just 
		doesn't ring a bell.&quot;<br />
		<br />
		The nun then takes a newspaper out of her habit and hands it to St. 
		Peter. He reads the paper and starts laughing. He hands it back to her 
		and says &quot;No sister, the paper says it was the 'Sahara Pipeline' that 
		was laid by 1,400 men in 6 months.&quot; </p>
            <hr />
            <p>There were these three farmers that wanted to win 
		the state fair contest for having the largest hog. They decide that they 
		should stick a cork in the pigs ass and feed him for a month before the 
		fair. The only problem was that none of them wanted to be the one to 
		stick the cork in. So they bought a monkey and trained him to stick 
		corks in bottles. After a week or two of this, they stick the monkey in 
		the pen with the pig and a cork, and after a minute, the monkey did what 
		he was supposed to do. The farmers fed the pig for a month and sure 
		enough, they won first prize. Once they got home, they realized they 
		still had to take the cork out. So they trained this same monkey to take 
		corks out of bottles. They stuck the monkey in the pen with the pig, and 
		the farmers woke up three days later in the hospital with a reporter 
		sitting next to them. The reporter asked the first farmer, &quot;What is the 
		last thing you remember?&quot; &quot;Shit flying everywhere,&quot; the farmer replied. 
		The reporter asked the second farmer the same question and got the same 
		response. When she got to the third farmer and asked him what he could 
		remember, he started crying. The reporter asked, &quot;What's the matter?&quot; 
		The farmer replied, &quot;The last thing I remember is the look on the poor 
		monkey's face as he tried to stick the cork back in.&quot;</p>

            <p>A fellow went off on his honeymoon, and after 
      returning meets up with a friend for a beer and conversation. The friend, 
      being single and a pervert to boot, begins to inquire as to the 
      festivities of the honeymoon. &quot;So, Bob, big married man, did ya get any 
      while you were out there?&quot; the friend asks. Bob just shakes his head. &quot;Ah, 
      you know me. I like to fish. So I just fished.&quot; His friend gasps. &quot;You 
      mean you didn't have no sex? C'mon, Bob, tell me at least got a blowjob!&quot; 
      Bob again shakes his head. &quot;Naw, she had pyorrhea, so I just fished. You 
      know I like to fish.&quot; His friend replies, &quot;Bob, she's your god damn wife! 
      She's gotta give it up when you say! You should just made her do it!&quot; Bob 
      replies, &quot;Nah, she had gonorrhea, and you know me. I like to fish, so I 
      just fished.&quot; His friend, now quite upset, says, &quot;What?! Why didn't ya 
      just pork it up her ass?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says Bob, &quot;she had diarrhea...and you 
      know me, I like to fish. So I just fished.&quot; His friend, totally 
      exasperated by this point, shouts at him, &quot;Jesus! Why'd you marry this 
      sick bitch anyway?!&quot; Bob replies, &quot;Well, she got worms, and you know how I 
      like to fish...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>She married and had 13 children. Her husband died. 
      She married again and had 7 more children. Again, Her husband died. But, 
      she remarried and this time had 5 more children. Alas, she finally died.
      <br />
      <br />
      Standing before her coffin, the preacher prayed for her. He thanked the 
      Lord for this very loving woman and said, �Lord, they�re finally 
      together.�<br />
      <br />
      One mourner leaned over and quietly asked her friend, �Do you think he 
      means her first, second or third husband?� The friend replied, �I think he 
      means her legs.�</p>

            <p>One Night After Watching Who Wants To Be A 
      Millionaire...
      A man and his wife went to bed and the man was getting very frisky. He 
      asked his wife if she was in the mood.
      His wife answered, &quot;Not tonight dear, I have a headache.&quot;
      The man replied, &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot;
      She said &quot;Yes.&quot;
      &quot;OK, then I'd like to phone a friend.&quot; he replied.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was this geriatric woman who thought she 
      needed some toughening to cope with today's world, and decided to join a 
      gang. She rocked up to the Hell's Angels bikers club and tapped on the 
      door. &quot;Excuse me, sirs, I'd like to join your club if you please&quot; she 
      croaked in her feeble voice. A grunt came from inside, &quot;Ha! You got no 
      chance, woman. We only take the toughest into our club. You can only join 
      if you drink!&quot;. &quot;Oh boy, do I drink! I slam a few down every night after 
      playing pool with the boys&quot; she croaked back. &quot;Oh, umm, well... you can 
      only join if you smoke&quot; he lied, trying to brush her off. &quot;Does marijuana 
      count? Coz I don't mind a few joints after playing pool with the boys&quot;. 
      &quot;Umm, I suppose it does count...&quot; the biker said, and, thinking quick on 
      his feet said &quot;Look, we're a gang only for the roughest, toughest men in 
      town. Now, have you ever been picked up by the fuzz?&quot;<br />
      &quot;No,&quot; she replied, &quot;but I've been swung around by the tits a few times&quot;.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A friend asked me the other day why I never got 
      married. I replied &quot;Well, I guess I just never met the right woman... I 
      guess I've been looking for the perfect girl.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Oh, come on now,&quot; said my friend. &quot;Surely you have met at least one girl 
      that you wanted to marry.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Yes, there was one girl... once. I guess she was the one perfect girl -- 
      the only perfect girl I really ever met. She was just the right 
      everything... I really mean that she was the perfect girl for me.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Well, why didn't you marry her?&quot; asked my friend. I shrugged my shoulders 
      and replied, &quot;She was looking for the perfect man.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A husband and wife are traveling by car from Atlanta 
      to New York. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they decide to 
      stop at a nice hotel and take a room. They only plan to sleep for four 
      hours and then get back on the road. When they check out four hours later, 
      the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350. The man explodes and demands to 
      know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice 
      hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350. When the clerk explains that 
      $350 is the standard rate, the man insists<br />
      on speaking to the manager.<br />
      <br />
      The manager enters the conversation and explains that the hotel has an 
      Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center which were available for 
      the husband and wife to use.<br />
      He also explains that they could have taken in one of the shows which the 
      hotel is famous for. &quot;The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and 
      Las Vegas perform here,&quot;<br />
      explains the manager.<br />
      <br />
      No matter what facility the manager mentions, the man replies, &quot;But we 
      didn't use it!&quot;<br />
      <br />
      The manager is unmoved. Eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He 
      writes a check and hands it to the manager. &quot;But sir,&quot; the managers says, 
      &quot;this check is only made out for $100.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;That's right,&quot; replies the man. &quot;I charged you $250 for sleeping with my 
      wife.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;What! I didn't sleep with your wife!&quot; exclaims the manager.<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Well,&quot; the man replies, &quot;she was here, and you could have.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The room was full of pregnant women and their 
      partners, and the Lamaze class was in full swing. The instructor was 
      teaching the women how to breathe properly, along with informing the men 
      how to give the necessary assurances at this stage of the plan. <br />
      <br />
      The teacher then announced, &quot;Ladies, exercise is good for you. Walking is 
      especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it wouldn't hurt you to take the 
      time to go walking with your partner!&quot; <br />
      <br />
      The room really got quiet. Finally, a man in the middle of the group 
      raised his hand. &quot;Yes?&quot; replied the teacher. &quot;Is it alright if she carries 
      a golf bag while we walk?&quot;</p>
