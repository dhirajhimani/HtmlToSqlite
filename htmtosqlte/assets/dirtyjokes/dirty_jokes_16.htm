            <p>Miss Annabell had just returned from her big
            trip to New York City and was having refreshments on the front porch
            of her daddy's mansion with her southern belle friends. She tells
            them the stories of her trip as they stare spellbound. &quot;You
            just wouldn't believe what they have there in New York City,&quot;
            says Miss Annabell. &quot;They have men there who kiss other men on
            the lips.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Miss Annabell's friends fan themselves and say, &quot;Oh my! Oh
            my!&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;They call them homosexuals,&quot; proclaims Miss Annabell.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh my! Oh my,&quot; proclaim the girls as they fan
            themselves.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;They also have women there in New York City who kiss other
            women on the lips!&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh my! Oh my,&quot; exclaim the girls. &quot;What do they call
            them?&quot; they ask.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;They call them lesbians,&quot; says Miss Annabell.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;They also have men who kiss women between the legs, there in
            New York City,&quot; sighs Miss Annabell.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh my! Oh my! Oh my,&quot; exclaim the girls as the sit on the
            edge of their chairs and fan themselves even faster. &quot;What do
            they call them?&quot; they ask in unison. Miss Annabell leans
            forward and says in a hush, &quot;Why when I caught my breath, I
            called him Precious.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A nerdy accountant is sent to jail for
            embezzlement and they put him in a cell with a huge evil looking
            guy. The big guy says, &quot;I want to have some sex. You wanna be
            the husband or the wife?&quot; The accountant replies, &quot;Well,
            if I have to be one or the other, I guess I'd rather be the
            husband.&quot; The big guy says, &quot;Okay. Now get over here and
            suck your wife's dick.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two hookers were on a street corner. They
            started discussing business, and one of the hookers said,
            &quot;Gonna be a good night, I smell cock in the air.&quot; The
            other hooker looked at her and said, &quot;No, I just burped.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A little boy is sitting in the barber's chair
            and becoming anxious, so the barber gives him a tootsie roll to keep
            him quiet. As the barber trims his bangs, loose hair falls over his
            face. &quot;Do you have hair on your goodie?&quot; asks the barber.
            &quot;Don't be silly, you old pervert! I'm only eight years
            old!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A retired gentlemen went into the social
            security office to apply for Social Security.<br />
            <br />
            After waiting in line a long time he got to the counter. The woman
            behind the counter asked him for his drivers license to verify his
            age. He looked in his pockets and realized he had left his wallet at
            home. He told the woman that he was very sorry but he seemed to have
            left his wallet at home. &quot;Will I have to go home and come back
            now?&quot; he asks. The woman says, &quot;Unbutton your shirt.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            So he opens his shirt revealing lots of curly silver hair. She says,
            &quot;That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me,&quot;
            and she processed his Social Security application. When he gets
            home, the man excitedly tells his wife about his experience at the
            Social Security office. She said, &quot;You should have dropped your
            pants, you might have qualified for disability, too.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A woman recently lost her
            husband. She had him cremated and brought his ashes home. Picking up
            the urn that he was in, she poured him out on the counter...</p>
            <p align="left">Then, while tracing her fingers
            in the ashes, she started talking to him. &quot;Irving, you know
            that fur coat you promised me? I bought it with the insurance
            money!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">&quot;Irving, remember that new
            car you promised me? Well, I also bought it with the insurance
            money!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Irving, that emerald necklace you promised me? I bought it,
            too, with the insurance money.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Still tracing her finger in the ashes, she said, &quot;Irving,
            remember that blow job I promised you? Here it comes.</p>

            <p align="left">Neighbor 1: &quot;Hi, there, new
            neighbor, it sure is a nice day to be moving&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;Yes, it is and people around here seem extremely
            friendly&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;So what is it you do for a living?&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;I am a professor at the University, I teach
            deductive reasoning&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Deductive reasoning, what is that?&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;Let me give you and example. I see you have a
            dog house out back. By that I deduce that you have a dog.&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;That is right&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;The fact that you have a dog, Leads me to deduce
            that you have a family.&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Right again&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;Since you have a family I deduce that you have a
            wife&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Correct&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;And since you have a wife, I can deduce that you
            are heterosexual&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Yup&quot;<br />
            New Neighbor: &quot;That is deductive reasoning&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Cool&quot;</p>
            <p align="left">Later that same day...</p>
            <p align="left">Neighbor 1: &quot;Hey, I was
            talking to that new guy who moved in next door&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 2: &quot;Is he a nice guy?&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Yes, and he has an interesting job&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 2: &quot;Oh, yeah what does he do?&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;He is a professor of deductive reasoning at the
            University&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 2: &quot;Deductive reasoning, what is that&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Let me give you an example. Do you have a dog
            house?&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 2: &quot;No&quot;<br />
            Neighbor 1: &quot;Fag.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A little old lady goes into the
            store to do some shopping. She is bewildered over the large
            selection of toilet paper. &quot;Pardon me, sir,&quot; she says to
            the store manager, &quot;but can you explain the differences in all
            these toilet papers?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he replies pointing out
            one brand, &quot;this is as soft as a baby's bottom. It's $1.50 per
            roll.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            He grabs another and says, &quot;This is nice and soft, strong but
            gentle, and it's $1.00 a roll.&quot; Pointing to the bottom shelf he
            tells her, &quot;We call that our No Name brand, and it's 20 cents
            per roll.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Give me the No Name,&quot; she says. She comes back about a
            week later, seeks out the manager&nbsp; and says, &quot;Hey! I've
            got a name for your No Name toilet paper. I call it John
            Wayne.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; he asks. &quot;Because it's rough,
            it's tough and it don't take crap from anybody!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">The officer shouted orders to a
            nearby soldier. With considerable bravery, the GI ran directly onto
            the field of&nbsp;battle, in the line of fire, to retrieve a
            dispatch case from a dead soldier. In a hail of bullets, he dove
            back to safety. &quot;Private,&quot; the officer said, &quot;I'm
            recommending you for a medal. You risked your life to save the
            locations of our secret warehouses.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Warehouses!?&quot; the private shouted. &quot;I thought you
            said whorehouses!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Three women were sitting around
            throwing back a few drinks and talking about their sex lives. Karen
            said, &quot;I call my husband the dentist because nobody can drill
            like he does.&quot; Joanne giggled and confessed, &quot;I call my
            husband the miner because of his incredible shaft.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Kathy quietly sipped her whiskey until Joanne finally asked,
            &quot;Well, what do you call your boyfriend?&quot; Kathy frowned and
            said, &quot;The postman.&quot; &quot;Why the postman?&quot; asked
            Joanne.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Because, he always delivers late and half the time it's in the
            wrong box.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A couple made a deal that whoever
            died first would come back and inform the other of the after life.
            The woman's biggest fear was that there was no heaven. After a long
            life, the husband was the first to go, and true to&nbsp;his word, he
            made contact. &quot;Mary... Mary...&quot; Awestruck, Mary responds,
            &quot;Is that you Fred?&quot; &quot;Yes, I have come back like we
            agreed.&quot; &quot;Well, what is it like?&quot; Fred excitedly
            tells his tale, &quot;Well, when I get up in the morning I have sex,
            then I have breakfast, then I have sex again, then I bathe in the
            sun, then I have sex twice more, then I have lunch, then I have sex
            all afternoon and into the early evening, until bedtime. And, then,
            I start all over again the next day.&quot; So happy Mary says,
            &quot;Oh Fred, you surely must be in heaven.&quot; Fred replies,
            &quot;Hell no, Mary, I'm a rabbit in Kansas.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Bill rents an apartment in
            Chicago, and goes to the lobby to put his name on the group mailbox.
            While he was there, an attractive young lady comes out of the
            apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe. Bill smiles at the
            young girl, so she strikes up a conversation with him.</p>
            <p align="left">As they talk, her robe slips
            open, and it's quite obvious that she has nothing on under the robe.
            Poor Bill breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.
            After a few minutes, he places her hand on his arm and says,
            &quot;Let's go to my apartment. I hear someone coming...&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            Bill follows her into the apartment. Once inside, she leans against
            the wall allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now completely
            nude, she purrs, &quot;What would you say is my best
            feature?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The flustered, embarrassed Bill stammers, clears his throat several
            times, and finally squeaks out, &quot;Oh, your best feature has to
            be your ears!&quot;&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            She's astounded! &quot;Why my ears? Looks at these breasts! They're
            full, they don't sag, and they're 100% natural! My butt is firm and
            doesn't sag, and have no cellulite! So, why in in the world would
            you say my ears are my best feature?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Clearing his throat once again, Bill stammers, &quot;Because, when
            we were in the hallway you said you heard someone coming... that was
            me!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Lori, the pert and pretty Nurse
            took her troubles to a resident psychiatrist in the hospital where
            she worked.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Doctor, you must help me.&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It's gotten
            so that every time I date one of the young doctors here, I&nbsp;<br />
            end up in bed with him. And then afterward, I feel guilty and
            depressed for a week.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I see.&quot; nodded the psychiatrist. &quot;And you want me to
            strengthen your will power and resolve in this matter?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;For God's sake, no!&quot; exclaimed the Nurse. &quot;I want
            you to fix it so I won't feel guilty and depressed afterwards.&quot;</p>

            <p>One night, a horny old geezer decides to get
            himself a hooker.<br />
            <br />
            Since the man doesn't have much money, he looks for the cheapest
            whore in the nearest Red Light District. A short while later, he
            finds what he's looking for and spends $10 for oral sex and
            intercourse.&nbsp;<br />
            <br />
            The next morning, the old geezer wakes up and discovers he has
            crabs. So, he gets dressed and heads down to where he had been the
            night before. He notices the same hooker on the street corner, so he
            marches over to her and says, &quot;Hey, lady, you gave me
            crabs!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The hooker replies, &quot;Hey, old man, what did you expect for $10?
            Lobster?&quot;</p>

            <p>The pretty teacher was concerned with one of

            &quot;Little Johnny, why has your school work been so poor
            lately?&quot; &quot;I'm in love,&quot; replied Little Johnny.
            Holding back an urge to smile, the teacher asked, &quot;With
            whom?&quot; &quot;With you!&quot; he said. &quot;But Little
            Johnny,&quot; said the teacher gently, &quot;don't you see how silly
            that is? Sure I'd like a husband of my own someday... but I don't
            want a child.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Oh, don't worry,&quot; said Little Johnny reassuringly,

            First was a carpenter, strong and bold, with a chisel and hammer, he
            gave it a hole. Second was a butcher, quick with his wit, with a
            steak knife he gave it a slit. Third was a hunter, short and stout,
            with a piece of fox fur he lined it without. Fourth was a tailor,
            tall and thin, with a piece of red velvet he lined it within. Fifth
            was a fisherman, nasty as hell, he threw in a fish and gave it a
            smell. Sixth was a preacher, his name was McGee, he blessed it and
            touched it and said it could pee. Seventh was a sailor, dirty little

            The woman tells her, &quot;I want you to get my gun from the desk,

            comes back to the phone, &quot;What do I do with the bodies?&quot;
            The woman says, &quot;Throw them in the swimming pool.&quot;
            Puzzled, the maid answers, &quot;But there's no pool here.&quot; A
