            <p align="left">A salesman in a strange city was
            feeling horny and wanted release. He inquired for the address of a
            good house of ill repute. He was told to go to 225 West 42nd St. By
            mistake, he went to 255 West 42nd St, the office of a podiatrist.
            Being met by a beautiful woman in a white uniform surprised but
            intrigued him. She directed him to an examining room and told him to
            uncover and someone would be with him soon.<br />
            <br />
            He loved the thought of the table and the reclining chair and was
            really getting aroused because of the strange and different approach
            this house offered. Finally the doctor's assistant, a really
            gorgeous redhead entered and found him sitting in the chair with his
            generous member in his hand. &quot;My goodness&quot;, she exclaimed,
            &quot;I was expecting to see a foot.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he
            said, &quot;if you're going to complain about an inch then I'll take
            my business elsewhere.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A guy stops by to visit his
            friend. They talk for a while and then the friend asks, &quot;My
            feet are cold. Would you be so kind as to go get me my sneakers
            please?&quot; The guest obliges and goes upstairs. There he sees his
            friend's daughters, both very good looking. Being the adventurous
            and quick thinking kind, he says: &quot;Hi, ladies! Your daddy sent
            me here to have sex with you!&quot; They stare at him and say,
            &quot;That can't be!&quot; He replies, &quot;OK, let's check!&quot;
            He shouts at his friend down the stairs, &quot;Both of them?&quot;
            &quot;Yes, both of them!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A guy starts talking to two women
            in a bar, they turn out to be Siamese twins, and they wind up back
            at his apartment. He makes love to one, and then starts to work on
            the other. He realizes that the first one might get bored watching,
            so he her asks what she'd like to do. She says, &quot;Is that a
            trombone in the corner? I'd love to play your trombone.&quot; So she
            plays it while he screws her sister. A few weeks later, the girls
            are walking past the guy's apartment building. One of the girls
            says, &quot;Let's stop up and see that guy.&quot; The other girl
            says, &quot;Gee...do you think he'd remember us?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A young teenager comes home from
            school and asks her mother, &quot;Is it true what Rita just told me?
            That babies come out of the same place where boys put their
            thingies?&quot; &quot;Yes, dear,&quot; replies her mother, pleased
            that the subject had finally come up and she wouldn't have to
            explain it. &quot;But then when I have a baby, won't it knock my
            teeth out?</p>

            <p align="left">A young girl was having a
            heart-to-heart talk with her mother on her first visit home since
            starting university. &quot;Mum, I have to tell you,&quot; the girl
            confessed. &quot;I lost my virginity last weekend.&quot; &quot;I'm
            not surprised,&quot; said her mother. &quot;It was bound to happen
            sooner or later. I just hope it was a romantic and pleasurable
            experience.&quot; &quot;Well, yes and no,&quot; the pretty student
            remarked. &quot;The first eight guys felt great, but after them my
            pussy got really sore.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">Jane was a first time contestant
            on the $65,000 quiz show, where you have to answer questions to win
            the cash prize.<br />
            <br />
            Lady luck had smiled in her favor, as Jane had a gained substantial
            lead over her opponents. She even managed to win the game but,
            unfortunately, time had run out before the show's host could ask her
            the big question. Needless to say, Jane agreed to return the
            following day. Jane was nervous and fidgety as her husband drove
            them home. &quot;I've just gotta win tomorrow. I wish I knew what
            the answers are. You know I'm not going to sleep at all tonight. I
            will probably look like garbage tomorrow.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Relax, honey,&quot; her husband, Roger, reassured her.
            &quot;It will all be OK.&quot; Ten minutes after they arrived home,
            Roger grabbed the car keys and started heading out the door.
            &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Jane asked. &quot;I have a little
            errand to run. I should be back soon&quot; he replied. Jane waited
            impatiently for Roger's return. After an agonizing 3 hour absence,
            Roger returned, sporting a very wide and wicked grin. &quot;Honey, I
            managed to get tomorrow's question and answer!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;What is it?&quot; she cried excitedly.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;OK. The question is: 'What are the three main parts of the
            male anatomy?' And the answer is 'The head, the heart, and the
            penis.' &quot; Shortly after that, the couple went to sleep with
            Jane, now feeling confident and at ease, plummeting into a deep and
            restful slumber. At 3:30 in the morning, however, Jane was shaken
            awake by Roger, who was asking her the quiz show question. &quot;The
            head, the heart, and the penis,&quot; Jane replied groggily before
            returning to sleep. And Roger asked her again in the morning, this
            time as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again, Jane replied
            correctly.<br />
            <br />
            So it was that Jane was once again on the set of the quiz show. Even
            though she knew the question and answer, she could feel the
            butterflies conquering her stomach and nervousness running through
            her veins. The cameras began running and the host, after reminding
            the audience of the previous days events, faced Jane and asked the
            big question.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Jane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of the male
            anatomy? You have 10 seconds.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Hmm, uhm, the head?&quot; she said nervously. &quot;Very good.
            Six seconds.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Eh, uh, the heart?&quot; &quot;Very good! Four seconds.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I, uhh, ooooooohh, darn! My husband drilled it into me last
            night and I had it on the tip of my tongue this morning...&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;That's close enough,&quot; said the game show host,
            &quot;CONGRATULATIONS!!!&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">Three women walking down the
            street are stopped by a man doing a survey. He asks, &quot;Ladies,
            would you mind telling me how you know if you've had a good night
            out?&quot; The first replies, &quot;I come home, get into bed and if
            I lay there and tingle all over, I know that I had a good
            night.&quot; The second one replies, &quot;I come home, have a
            shower and a glass of wine, get into bed, and if I tingle all over,
            I know it was a good night.&quot; The third one turns around and
            says, &quot;If I get home, rip off me knickers, throw them against
            the wall, and they stick, then I know it was a good night!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">There's a few guys who always get
            together on Fridays after work for a drink... One Friday, Jeff
            showed up late, sat down at the bar, and kicked back his entire
            first beer in one gulp... Then he turned to Bob and said,
            &quot;Times are getting tough my friend, I mean, just today my wife
            told me that she's going to cut me back to only two times a week...
            I can't believe it&quot;... At which point Bob put his hand on
            Jeff's shoulder and said reassuringly, &quot;You think you've got it
            bad, she's cut some guys out all together&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A man was driving down a quiet
            country lane when out into the road strayed a rooster. Whack! The
            rooster disappeared under the car in a cloud of feathers. Shaken,
            the man pulled over at the farmhouse and rang the doorbell. A farmer
            appeared. The man somewhat nervously said, &quot;I think I killed
            your rooster, please allow me to replace him.&quot; &quot;Suit
            yourself,&quot; the farmer replied, &quot;the hens are round the
            back.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy went out hunting. He had all the gear,
            the jacket, the boots and the double-barreled shotgun. As he was
            climbing over a fence, he dropped the gun and it went off, right on
            his penis. Obviously, he had to see a doctor. When he woke up from
            surgery, he found that the doctor had done a marvelous job repairing
            it. As he got ready to go home, the doctor gave him a business card.
            &quot;This is my brothers card. I'll make an appointment for you to
            see him.&quot; The guy says &quot;Is your brother a doctor?&quot;
            &quot;No,&quot; Doc replies, &quot;he plays the flute. He'll show
            you where to put your fingers so you don't piss in your eye.&quot;</p>

            <p align="left">A little boy was attending his
            first wedding. After the service, his younger cousin asked him,
            &quot;How many women can a man marry?&quot; &quot;Sixteen.&quot; the
            boy responded. His cousin was amazed that he answered so quickly.
            &quot;How do you know that?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Easy,&quot; the little boy said, &quot;all you have to do is
            add it up, like the preacher said: 'Four better, four worse, four
            richer, four poorer'.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p align="left">A man wanted to determine if both
            his wife and mistress were faithful to him. So he decided to send
            them on the same cruise, then later question each one on the other's
            behavior. When his wife returned, he asked her about the people on
            the trip in general, then casually asked her about the specific
            behavior of the passenger he knew to be his mistress. &quot;She
            slept with nearly every man on the ship,&quot; his wife reported.
            The disheartened man then rendezvoused with his cheating mistress to
            ask her the same questions about his wife. &quot;She was a real
            lady,&quot; his mistress said. &quot;How so?&quot; the encouraged
            man asked. &quot;She came on board with her husband and never left
            his side.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man comes home from a night of drinking. As
            he falls through the doorway, his wife snaps at him, &quot;What's
            the big idea coming home half drunk?&quot; The man replies,
            &quot;I'm sorry honey. I ran out of money.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A well-stacked young advertising secretary
            wore tight knit dresses that showed off her figure, especially when
            she walked. Her young, aggressive boss motioned her into his office
            one afternoon and closed the door. Pointing to her tightly covered
            derriere, he asked, &quot;Is that for sale?&quot; &quot;Of course
            not!&quot; she snapped angrily, blushing furiously. Unchanged, he
            replied quietly, &quot;Then, I suggest you quit advertising
            it.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man was wandering around a fairground and he
            happened to see a fortune-teller's tent. Thinking it would be good
            for a laugh, he went inside and sat down. &quot;Ah.....&quot; said
            the woman as she gazed into her crystal ball. &quot;I see you are
            the father of two children.&quot; &quot;That's what you think,&quot;
            said the man scornfully. &quot;I'm the father of THREE
            children.&quot;� The woman grinned and said, &quot;That's what YOU
            think!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young guy was laying on his back on a
            massage table, wearing only a towel over his groin. A young, very
            attractive Swedish girl was massaging his shoulders, then his chest,
            and gradually worked her way down his torso. The guy was getting
            sexually excited as the masseur approached the towel. The towel
            began to lift and the Swedish girl arched her eyebrows. &quot;You
            wanna wank?&quot; she asked. &quot;You bet,&quot; came the excited
            reply. &quot;O.K.,&quot; she said. &quot;I come back in ten
            minutes.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This guy was walking down the street and this
            hooker says, &quot;Say, wanna have a good time?&quot; as he looked
            him up and down seductively. &quot;Sure,&quot; he says and they are
            off to the nearest motel. She takes off her clothes and he keeps
            staring at her. She says, &quot;Is this the first pussy you seen
            since you crawled out of one?&quot; The guy says, &quot;Nope, just
            the first one I've seen big enough to crawl back into.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy goes to the supermarket and notices an attractive woman waving at him. She says hello.
              He's rather taken aback because he can't place where he knows her from.
              
              So he says, 'Do you know me?' To which she replies, 'I think you're the father of one of my kids.'
              Now his mind travels back to the only time he has ever been unfaithful to his wife and says, 'Are you the stripper from the bachelor party that I made love to on the pool table with all my buddies watching while your partner whipped my butt with wet celery???'
           She looks into his eyes and says calmly, 'No, I'm your son's teacher.'</p>
