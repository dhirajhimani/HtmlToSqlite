            <hr />
            <p>A guy goes to a doctor and says, &quot;Doc,
            you've got to help me. My penis is orange.&quot; Doctor pauses to
            think and asks the guy to drop his pants so he can check. Damned if
            the guy's penis isn't orange. Doc tells the guy, &quot;This is very
            strange. Sometimes things like this are caused by a lot of stress in
            a person's life.&quot;</p>
            <p>Probing as to the causes of possible stress,
            the doc asks the guy, &quot;How are things going at work?&quot; The
            guy responds that he was fired about six weeks ago. The doctor tells
            him that this must be the cause of the stress. Guy responds,
            &quot;No. The boss was a real asshole, I had to work 20-30 hours of
            overtime every week and I had no say in anything that was happening.
            I found a new job a couple of weeks ago where I can set my own
            hours, I'm getting paid double what I got on the old job and the
            boss is a really great guy.&quot; So the doc figures this isn't the
            reason.</p>
            <p>He asks the guy, &quot;How's your home
            life?&quot; The guy says, &quot;Well, I got divorced about eight
            months ago.&quot; The doc figures that this has got to be the reason
            for all of the guys stress. Guy says, &quot;No. For years, all I
            listened to was nag, nag, nag. God, am I glad to be rid of that old
            bitch.&quot; So the doc takes a few minutes to think a little
            longer.</p>
            <p>He inquires, &quot;Do you have any hobbies or
            a social life?&quot; The guy replies, &quot;No, not really. Most
            nights I sit home, watch some porno flicks and munch on Cheetos.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>It was the mailman's last day on the job after
            35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the
            same neighborhood. When he arrived at the first house on his route
            he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and
            sent him on his way with a big gift envelope. At the second house
            they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third
            house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.</p>
            <p>At the fourth house he was met at the door by
            a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him
            by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed
            behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew
            his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When
            he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant
            breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and
            fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured
            him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a
            dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.</p>
            <p>&quot;All this was just too wonderful for
            words,&quot; he said, &quot;but what's the dollar for?&quot;
            &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;last night, I told my husband that
            today would be your last day, and that we should do something
            special for you. I asked him what to give you.&quot; He said,
            &quot;Fuck him, give him a dollar.&quot; The lady then said,
            &quot;The breakfast was my idea.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man walks into a bank, and after waiting for
            20 minutes in line, he goes straight to a customer service rep. and
            says, &quot;Hey, lady, I got this here check for deposit and I'll be
            goddamned if I am going to wait my ass on line anymore.&quot;
            &quot;Please&quot;, says the woman. &quot;I won't have that kind of
            language in this bank.&quot; &quot;Well excuse me, but this fuckin'
            check ain't drawing any goddamned interest with you yappin' away
            about my language.&quot; &quot;Sir, I don't have to take this
            abuse&quot; she says. &quot;Well then let's get the fuckin' manager
            okay? I mean what kind of shit is this I have to take from
            you?&quot; The manager is summoned, and says &quot;What seems to be
            the problem?&quot; The woman says, &quot;This man is using vulgar
            language and I won't stand for it.&quot; The man says &quot;Hey alls
            I'm trying to do in this goddamned bank, for Christ's sake is
            deposit this fuckin' check for 15 million dollars.&quot; The manager
            looks at the check and then at the man and says &quot;And this
            fuckin' bitch won't help you?&quot;</p>

            <p>There was a guy riding through the desert on
            his camel. He had been traveling so long that he felt the need to
            have sex. Obviously there were no women in the desert so the man
            turned to his camel. He tried to position himself to have sex with
            his camel but the camel ran away. The man ran to catch up to the
            camel and got back on and started to ride again. Soon he was feeling
            the urge to have sex again so once again he turned to his camel. The
            camel refused by running away. So he caught up to it again and go on
            it again. Finally after riding the camel through the whole desert
            the man came to a road. There was a broken down car with three big
            chested beautiful blondes sitting in it. He went up to them and
            asked the women if they needed any help. The hottest girl said
            ,&quot;If you fix our car we will do anything you want.&quot; The
            man luckily knew a thing or two about cars and fixed it in a flash.
            When he finished are three girls asked,&quot;How could we ever repay
            you Mr.&quot; After thinking for a short while he
            replied,&quot;Could you hold my camel?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Three explorers are captured by a tribe in the
            Amazon jungle. The chief is going to punish the intruders. He calls
            the first explorer to the front of the tribe and asks, &quot;Death
            or Booka?!&quot;. Well the explorer doesn't want to die, so he opts
            for booka. The tribe starts screaming BOOKA! and dancing around. the
            cheif then rips the explorers pants off and fucks him in the ass.</p>
            <p>The cheif calls the second explorer to the
            front and asks, &quot;Death or Booka?!&quot;. Well not wanting to
            die either, he opts for booka. The tribe again starts screaming
            BOOKA! and dancing around. The cheif rips the second guys pants off
            and fucks him in the ass.</p>
            <p>The chief calls the third explorer to the
            front and asks, &quot;Death or Booka?!&quot;. Well the third guy has
            a little more self respect and thinks death would be better than
            being violated in front of hundreds of tribesman, so he opts for
            death. The chief turns to the tribe and screams &quot;DEATH BY BOOKA!&quot;</p>

            <p>A farmer is lying in bed with his wife when he
            turns to her grabs her tits and says &quot;Honey if you could get
            milk out of these we could sell the cow&quot;. Then he grabs her
            pussy and says &quot;Honey if you could get eggs out of here we
            could sell the chickens&quot;. She turns to him smiles,grabs his
            dick and says &quot;Honey if you could get this up I could get rid
            of your brother&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This man is walking down the road and hears
            someone crying. He stops and looks over the fence and sees a woman
            without any arms or legs crying beside a pool. He asks &quot;What's
            the problem?&quot; she says &quot;Well I've never been hugged
            before.&quot; Well this is a nice guy so he hops the fence and gives
            her a hug. Half an hour later he is going back to his car and hears
            her crying. He asks &quot;Now what's wrong?&quot; she says
            &quot;I've been thinking and..I've never been kissed before&quot;.
            Well the guy thinks what's the harm in giving her a kiss to make her
            feel better? He hops the fence and gives her a kiss. At his car he
            finds that his keys are lost so he goes back to the girl and finds
            his keys there but he sees her crying again. &quot;Now what's
            wrong&quot; he asked She responds &quot;I've never been fucked
            before&quot; The guy picks her up and throws her into the pool and
            says &quot;Now you're fucked real good.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This lady goes to the gynecologist but won't
            tell the receptionist what's wrong with her, just that she must see
            a doctor. After hours of waiting the doctor sees her in. Ok my good
            woman what is your problem the doctor asks. Well, she says, my
            husband is a very compulsive gambler and every nickel he can get his
            hands on he gambles. So I had five hundred dollars and I stuffed it
            in my vagina but now I can't get it out. The doctor says, don't be
            nervous I see this happen all the time. He asks her to pull down her
            underwear sits her down with her legs wide open puts his gloves on
            and says: I only have one question. What am I looking for? Bills or
            loose change?</p>

            <p>A man walks up to the bar, and speaks to the
            bartender. &quot;I bet you $500 that I can piss in this cup from
            across the room.&quot; The bartender looks at the man like he was
            nuts and says with a laugh, &quot;Ooook buddy. You got a deal.&quot;
            So the man walks over to the other side of the room, pulls down his
            zipper and just lets it fly. Piss goes everywhere; on the bar, on
            customers, all over the bartender, but not a drop lands in the cup.
            The man walks back over to the bartender. The bartender says,
            &quot;Ha ha ha. Well pay up.&quot; So the man pays him, turns around
            and begins to laugh hysterically. The bartender asks, &quot;You just
            lost $500, why are you laughing?&quot; The man turns around and says
            to the bartender, &quot;Well you see that man over there.&quot; The
            bartender says, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He replies, &quot;Well, I bet him
            $10,000 that I could piss all over your bar and you, and that you

            &quot;No, doesn't the church look down on that?&quot; the priest
            says &quot;Well, yes, but in some cases we'll make an
            exception.&quot; The next day, the two boys come down for breakfast
            and she asks Tommy what he wants for breakfast. Tommy says
            &quot;Well, gimme some fucking waffles.&quot; The mom backhands
            Tommy so hard, he flies out of his chair and lands against the door.
            shocked and terrified by this, Timmy becomes very quiet. his mother
            asks him what he wants for breakfast, and his reply was &quot;Well

            <p>Three hillbillies were sitting on the porch.
            The first hillbilly said &quot;My wife is so dumb, yesterday she
            drug home a brand new washer and dryer, and we ain't even got
            electricity!&quot; The second hillbilly said &quot;My wife is

            we ain't even got runnin water!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The third hillbilly said &quot;My wife is even stupider! Yesterday I
            was in the kitchen and I saw her purse on the table. Everything was
            spilled out of it and there was a bunch of rubbers layin there...
            and she ain't even got a dick!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was a guy who was struggling to decide
            what to wear to go to a fancy costume party... Then he had a bright
            idea. When the host answered the door, he found the guy standing
            there with no shirt and no socks on. &quot;What the hell are you
            supposed to be?&quot; asked the host. &quot;A premature
            ejaculation,&quot; said the man. &quot;I just came in my
            pants!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This guy walks into the bar and sees a
            gorgeous blonde sitting on a bar stool all alone. So the guy sits
            down next to her and pulls a small box from his pocket. He opens it
            and there's a frog inside. The blonde says, &quot;He's cute, but
            does he do tricks?&quot; The guy says, &quot;Yea, he licks
            pussy.&quot; So after talking with her for several minutes, he
            convinces her to come with him to his apartment. They get there and
            she takes all of her clothes off, gets into the bed and spreads her
            legs. The guy sets the frog right between her legs and it just sits
            there not moving at all. the blond says, &quot;Well? what's
            up?&quot; The frog still does not move. So the guy leans over to the
            frog and says, &quot;All right, I'm only going to show you how to do
            this one more time!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>This lady is having a bed wetting problem, so
            she decides to go to the doctor. The doctor tells her to go and get
            undressed and wait for him in the other room. When the doctor goes
            into the room he tells the lady to stand on her head facing the
            mirror. She figures he is a doctor and gets in front of the mirror.
            The doctor goes over to the lady and rests his chin between her legs
            and looks in the mirror. After a few minutes he stands up and tells
            the lady to go ahead and put her clothes back on and he will talk to
            her when she is dressed.</p>
            <p><br />
            The lady puts her clothes on and asks the doctor what is wrong with
            her. He tells her that she needs to quit drinking before she goes to
            bed. The lady asks the doctor why he had her get naked in front of
            the mirror and stand on her head. He replies, &quot;I wanted to see
            how I would look with a beard.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A bear and a bunny are sitting in a forest
            taking a shit. The bear leans over to the bunny and says &quot;Do
            you ever have the problem of shit sticking to your fur&quot;? The
            bunny says &quot;No&quot;. So the bear grabs the bunny and wipes his
            ass.</p>

            <p>This nun was going to Chicago. She went to the
            airport and sat down waiting for her flight. When she looked over in
            the corner and saw one of those weight machines that tells your
            fortune. So she thought to herself I'll give it a try just to see
            what it tells me. So she went over to the machine and she put her
            nickel in and card came out and it said, Your a nun you weigh 128lbs
            and your going to Chicago Illinois. So she sat back down and thought
            about it, she thought to herself it probably tells everyone the same
            thing, I'm going try it again.</p>
            <p>So she went over to the machine again and put
            her nickel in it, a card came out and said, your nun, you weigh
            128lbs., your going to Chicago Ill. and your going to play a fiddle.
            She said to herself I know that's wrong I have never played a
            musical instrument a day in my life. She sat back down and this
            Cowboy came over and set his fiddle case down she picked up the
            fiddle and just started playing beautiful music. She looked back at
            the machine and said this is incredible I've got to try it again.</p>
            <p>So she went back to the machine put her nickel
            in another card came out and it said, your a nun, you weigh 128lbs.,
            your going to Chicago Ill. and your going to break wind. She thinks
            I know it's wrong now I've never broke wind in public a day in my
            life, well she tripped and fell off the scales and FARTED like a bay
            mule. So she sat back down and looked at the machine once again. She
            said to herself this is truly unbelievable, I've got to try it
            again.</p>
            <p>She went back to the machine, put her nickel
            in and a card came out and said, your a nun, you weigh 128lbs., your
            going to Chicago Ill. and your going to have sex. She said ah-hah
            that does it I know for sure its wrong now, I'm a nun, ain't ever
            had none, and ain't ever gonna get none. Well a huge electrical
            storm came through and the electricity went off and she got raped...
            She sat back down and thought about it for few minutes and then said
            this is truly, truly, incredible. But one thing is for certain, I've
            got to try it again just to see what is gonna happen to me before I
            leave this airport.</p>
            <p>She went over to the machine put her nickel in
            and a card came out and it said. Your a nun, you weigh 128lbs., you
            have fiddled, farted, fucked around and missed your flight to
            Chicago!!!!!!!!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman and a man are involved in a car
            accident; it's a bad one. Both of their cars are totally demolished
            but amazingly neither of them are hurt.<br />
            <br />
            After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, &quot;So you're
            a man, that's interesting. I'm a woman. Wow, just look at our cars!
            There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This must be a
            sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together
            in peace for the rest of our days.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Flattered, the man replied, &quot;Oh yes, I agree with you
            completely!&quot;<br />
            <br />
            &quot;This must be a sign from God!&quot; The woman continued,
            &quot;And look at this, here's another miracle. My car is completely
            demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us
            to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Then she hands the bottle to the man, The man nods his head in
            agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it
            back to the woman.<br />
            <br />
            The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and
            hands it back to the man.<br />
            <br />
            The man asks, &quot;Aren't you having any?&quot;<br />
            <br />
            The woman replies, &quot;No. I think I'll just wait for the
            police...&quot;</p>
