         <p>Darren marries this girl, and they go on their 
            honeymoon. He leaves the room the first night to go down to the 
            lobby to get a pack of cigarettes. When he gets back, his bride is 
            lying on the bed naked fucking one of the bellhops. Another one is 
            under her, getting her in the ass. She's sucking off the desk clerk, 
            and she's jerking off a cab driver and the dishwasher. Darren 
            screams, &quot;What the fuck are all these jerk-offs doing in here?&quot; She 
            says, &quot;Well, you always knew I was a flirt.&quot;</p>

         <p>A Roadway driver is driving east on Route 66 he 
         sees a truck driving west and the CB crackles to life. &quot;Hey Roadway 
         driver, who are the two biggest fags in America?&quot; comes from the CB. The 
         Roadway driver replies, &quot;I don't know.&quot; The other trucker says &quot; You 
         and your brother.&quot; Well the Roadway driver gets  annoyed but the 
         other driver tells him &quot;It's just a joke - tell it to the next truck 
         you see.&quot; <br />
         <br />
         Well the Roadway driver drives for about an hour and finally sees 
         another truck. He gets on the CB and says &quot;Hey other truck, do you know 
         who the two biggest fags in the world are?&quot; The other trucker says, &quot;I 
         don't know, who?&quot; The roadway driver replies &quot;Me and my brother.&quot;</p>

         <p>Bob says to Lester, &quot;You know, I reckon I'm about 
         ready for a vacation, only this year I'm gonna do it a little 
         different. The last few years, I took your advice as to where to go. 
         Two years ago you said to go to Hawaii, I went to Hawaii, and Marie got 
         pregnant. Then last year, you told me to go to the Bahamas, I went to 
         the Bahamas, and Marie got pregnant again.&quot; Lester says, &quot;So what you 
         gonna do different this year?&quot; Bob says, &quot;This year, I'm takin' Marie 
         with me...&quot;</p>

         <p>A guy's eating in a restaurant and spots a 
         gorgeous woman sitting all alone. He calls over his waiter and says, 
         &quot;Send that woman a bottle of your most expensive champagne, on me.&quot; The 
         waiter quickly brings the champagne over to the woman, and says, 
         &quot;Ma'am, this is from the gentleman over there.&quot; She says to the waiter, 
         &quot;Please tell him that for me to accept this champagne, he better have a 
         Mercedes in his garage, a million dollars in the bank, and eight inches 
         in his pants.&quot; The waiter delivers the message, and the guy says, 
         &quot;Please go back and tell her I have two Mercedes in my garage, three 
         million dollars in the bank, but I haven't even met her...so why the 
         fuck would I cut off four inches?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
         <p>A guy is walking around in a supermarket yelling, 
         &quot;Cris-co, Cris-co?&quot; A store clerk says to him, &quot;Sir, the Crisco is in 
         Aisle Five.&quot; He says, &quot;I'm not looking for cooking Crisco, I'm calling 
         my wife.&quot; The clerk says, &quot;Your wife is named Crisco'?&quot; He says, &quot;No, I 
         only call her that in public.&quot; The clerk says, &quot;What do you call her 
         when you're home?&quot; He says, &quot;Lard ass.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
         <p>Three very macho mice are standing around 
            trying to outdo each other. The first mouse says, &quot;You know those 
            little pellets they put out around the house trying to poison us? I 
            love those things. I eat 'em like candy.&quot; The second mouse, not to 
            be outdone says, &quot;Oh yeah? Well, you know those mousetraps they put 
            out to try to catch us? What I do is get on the trap, grab the 
            cheese, and then flip over onto my back, and when the steel bar 
            comes swinging down I grab it and do bench presses with it.&quot; The 
            third mouse says, &quot;You guys are really a couple of tough mice, and 
            I'd love to keep hangin' out with you here, but I gotta go fuck the 
            cat.&quot;</p>

         <p>A funeral service is being held for a woman who 
         has just passed away. At the end of the service, the pall bearers are 
         carrying the casket out when they accidentally bump into a wall, 
         jarring the casket. They hear a faint moan! They open the casket and 
         find that the woman is actually alive!</p>
         <p>She lives for ten more years, and then dies. Once 
         again, a ceremony is held, and at the end of it, the pall bearers are 
         again carrying out the casket. As they carry the casket towards the 
         door, the husband cries out: &quot;Watch that fucking wall!&quot; </p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman walks into her accountant's office and 
         tells him that she needs to file her taxes. The accountant says, 
         &quot;Before we begin, I'll need to ask a few questions. He gets her name, 
         address, social security number, etc. and then asks&nbsp; &quot;What is your 
         occupation?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         The woman replies, &quot;I'm a high-priced whore.&quot; The accountant balks and 
         says, &quot;No, no, no. That will never work. That is much too crass. Let's 
         try to rephrase that.&quot; The woman says, &quot;OK, I'm a high-end call girl!&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;No, that is still too crude. Try again.&quot; They both think for a minute, 
         then the woman states, &quot;I'm an elite chicken farmer.&quot; The accountant 
         asks, &quot;What does chicken farming have to do with being a whore or a 
         call girl?&quot; &quot;Well, I raised over 5,000 little peckers last year.&quot;</p>

            <p>This guy takes his girlfriend out to dinner (at a 
         buffet of course). They then go back to her apartment, sit down on the 
         couch, and start smooching. Suddenly he leaves a big fart. Not wanting 
         to embarrass him, his girlfriend says, &quot;Fido, get out from under this 
         sofa&quot;. They go back to their smooching, and a while later he leaves 
         another loud fart. Once again she says louder, &quot;Fido get out from under 
         this sofa.&quot; As they get back into the throws of passion, yet again he 
         blasts another fart, and his girlfriend says, &quot; Fido get out from under 
         this sofa - before he shits all over you.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>The judge says to a double-homicide defendant, 
         &quot;You're charged with beating your wife to death with a hammer.&quot; A voice 
         at the back of the courtroom yells out, &quot;You bastard.&quot; The judge says, 
         &quot;You're also charged with beating your mother-in-law to death with a 
         hammer.&quot; The voice in the back of the courtroom yells out, &quot;You 
         God-damned bastard.&quot; The judge stops, and says to the guy in the back 
         of the courtroom, &quot;Sir, I can understand your anger and frustration at 
         this crime. But no more outbursts from you, or I'll charge you with 
         contempt. Is that a problem?&quot; The guy in the back of the court stands 
         up and says, &quot;For fifteen years, I've lived next door to that bastard, 
         and every time I asked to borrow a hammer, he said he didn't have one.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A man walked out into the street and managed to 
         get a taxi just going by. What luck, he thought, as he slid into the 
         cab. &quot;Perfect timing,&quot; the cabby said. &quot;You're just like Bill.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Who?&quot; asked the man. &quot;Bill Smith. There's a guy who did everything 
         right,&quot; the cabby said. &quot;Like my coming along when you needed a cab. It 
         would have happened like that to Bill every time.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Nah,&quot; the man said to the cabby. &quot;There are always a few clouds over 
         everybody.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Not Bill,&quot; said the cabby. &quot;He was a terrific athlete. He could have 
         gone on the pro tour in tennis. He could
         golf with the pros. He sang like an opera baritone and danced like a 
         Broadway star.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Bill was really something, huh?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; continued the cabby. &quot;Bill had a memory like a trap. Could 
         remember everybody's birthday. He knew all about wine, which fork to 
         eat with. He could fix anything. Not like me. I change a fuse, and the 
         whole neighborhood blacks out.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;No wonder you remember him,&quot; the man said. &quot;Well, I never actually met 
         Bill,&quot; said the cabby. &quot;Then how in the world do you know so much about 
         him?&quot; &quot;I married his widow,&quot; replied the cabby.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A husband emerged from the bathroom naked and was 
         climbing into bed when his wife complained, as usual, &quot;I have a 
         headache.&quot; &quot;Perfect,&quot; her husband said. &quot;I was just in the bathroom 
         powdering my penis with aspirin. You can take it orally or as a 
         suppository, it's up to you!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Two gay gentlemen were walking through a zoo. 
            They came across the gorillas and after a while they noticed that 
            the huge male gorilla had a massive erection. This fascinated the 
            gay men so much they couldn't take their eyes off of it. One of the 
            men just couldn't bear it any longer and he reached into the cage to 
            touch it. The gorilla grabbed him, dragged him into the cage and 
            screwed him for six hours non-stop.</p>
            <p>When he was done, the gorilla threw the gay 
            man back out of the cage. An ambulance was called and the man was 
            taken away to the hospital. The next day his friend visits him in 
            the hospital and asked, &quot;Are you hurt?&quot; &quot;AM I HURT?&quot; he shouted, 
            &quot;Wouldn't you be? That big ape hasn't called, he hasn't written...&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>An 85-year old husband and wife decide to take a 
         road trip. She drives because she can see and he rides because he can 
         hear.<br />
         <br />
         After traveling for a while, they get pulled over by a State Trooper. 
         She rolls down her window and the cop says &quot;I need to see your drivers 
         license and vehicle registration please.&quot; The woman turns to her 
         husband and shouts &quot;WHAT DID HE SAY?&quot; The husband replies, &quot;HE WANTS 
         YOUR LICENSE AND REGISTRATION!&quot;<br />
         <br />
         The woman gives the documents to the officer and after studying her 
         license the cop says, &quot;Oh, you're from Chicago. I've been there. 
         Actually, the worse piece of ass I ever had was in Chicago!&quot; The woman 
         turns to her husband and shouts &quot;WHAT DID HE SAY?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         And the husband replies, &quot;HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A couple's taking a walk, and as they walk 
            hand-in-hand, the guy starts to get aroused. He's just about to get 
            frisky when she says, &quot;I hope you don't mind, but I have to take a 
            pee.&quot; He says, &quot;Sure, go behind the hedge.&quot; She disappears behind 
            the hedge, and as he waits, he hears the sound of her jeans being 
            rolled down her legs and imagines her exposed twat. He can't contain 
            himself, so he reaches through a gap in the hedge and touches her 
            leg. Then he moves his hand up her thigh until he finds himself 
            gripping something long and thick between her legs. He says, &quot;My 
            God, Mary, did you change your sex?&quot; She says, &quot;No, I changed my 
            mind. I'm taking a shit instead.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Finding one of her students making faces at 
         others on the playground, Ms. Smith stopped to gently reprove the 
         child. Smiling sweetly, the Sunday school teacher said, &quot;Johnny, when I 
         was a child, I was told if that I made ugly faces, it would freeze and 
         I would stay like that.&quot; Johnny looked up and replied, &quot;Well, Ms Smith, 
         you can't say you weren't warned.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>There was a boy whose parents were very strict in 
         his upbringing.&nbsp;They never allowed him to meet any girls, except his 
         own&nbsp;relatives. However, one day he saw one of his best friends&nbsp;kissing 
         a girl and he went to his mother and asked her what they&nbsp;were doing.<br />
         His mother told him, &quot;It's called kissing and any boy who does&nbsp;that to 
         a girl will die that very minute!&quot; On his 21st birthday he went out 
         with some friends who&nbsp;introduced him to one of the sweetest girls 
         around town.&nbsp;She knew that he had never been kissed before. When she 
         eventually got some time alone with him, she tried to&nbsp;kiss him but he 
         resisted. She asked him, &quot;What are you afraid&nbsp;of, it won't hurt.&quot; He 
         said, &quot;My mother said if I kiss a girl I'll die this very&nbsp;minute!!&quot; She 
         replied, &quot;Don't be a baby, now come on kiss me.&quot;&nbsp;With that she gave him 
         a hot one square across the lips. He began to cry, &quot;Oh no I'm going to 
         die!!!&quot; She said, &quot;Why are you going to die??&quot; He replied, &quot;I've just 
         kissed you and already one part of&nbsp;me has begun to get stiff!!&quot;</p>
