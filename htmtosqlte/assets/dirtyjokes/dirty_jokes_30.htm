            <p>This little boy goes up to his dad and he says 
         &quot;Dad?, What's the difference between Potentially and Realistically?&quot; To 
         which the father replies &quot;Well son, go ask your mother if she would 
         sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. Then you ask your 
         sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars. Then 
         you ask your brother if he would sleep with Tom Cruise for a million 
         dollars.&quot; So the boy goes up to his mom and asks her if she would sleep 
         with Robert Redford for a million dollars and the mother replies &quot;Oh my 
         god, of course I would, he is so good looking!&quot; So the boy moves on and 
         asks his sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million 
         dollars, and she replies &quot;He is so fucking fine, of course I would!&quot; 
         Then last but no least he goes up to his brother and asks him if he 
         would sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars, his brother says &quot;Of 
         course I would, who wouldn't for a million bucks?&quot; So he goes up to his 
         dad and says &quot;I think I learned the difference between potentially and 
         realistically&quot; &quot;Well what's the difference?&quot; says the father. &quot;Well, 
         potentially we're sitting on 3 million dollars, realistically we're 
         living with 2 sluts and a fag!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>&quot;Mom, may I take the dog for a walk around the 
         block?&quot; a little girl asked. &quot;No, I don't think so. Fifi is in heat,&quot;
         replied the mother. &quot;What does that mean?&quot; asked the child. Embarrassed 
         and not wanting to get into a
         biological discussion with her young daughter, the Mother said, &quot;Oh, 
         just go ask your father. I think he is in the garage.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         The little girl goes to the garage and says, &quot;Dad, may I take Fifi for 
         a walk around the block? I asked Mom, but she said that Fifi was in 
         heat, and that I had to come talk to you.&quot; Not wanting to have the 
         biological discussion
         either, the father said, &quot;Bring Fifi over here.&quot; He took a rag, soaked 
         it with gasoline, and scrubbed the dog's rear end with it. &quot;Okay, now 
         you can go for a walk but keep Fifi on the leash and you can only go 
         around the block once.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         The little girl left, and returned a few minutes later with NO DOG on 
         the leash. &quot;Where is Fifi?&quot; her father asked.
         &quot;She should be here in a minute,&quot; advised the daughter. &quot;She ran out of 
         gas about halfway down the block and another dog is pushing her home.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Researcher: Excuse me madam, I'm conducting a 
         survey.<br />
         Woman: Yes, what is it about?<br />
         Researcher: We are asking people what they think about sex on the 
         television...<br />
         Woman: Very uncomfortable, I would imagine!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A young , attractive woman thought she might have 
         some fun with a stiff-looking military man at a cocktail party, so she 
         walked over and asked him, &quot;Major, when was the last time you had sex?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;1956,&quot; was his reply. &quot;No wonder you look so uptight!&quot; she exclaimed. 
         &quot;Major, you need to get out more!&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;I'm not sure I understand you,&quot; he answered, glancing at his watch, 
         ...&quot;It's only 2014 now.&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A Little Rabbit is running happily through the 
         woods when he comes across a Giraffe rolling a joint. He runs up the 
         Giraffe and says, &quot;Hey, Giraffe. You shouldn't do that. Think of your 
         health. You should come running in the woods instead!&quot; The Giraffe 
         looks at the Little Rabbit, looks at the spliff, shrugs his shoulders, 
         tosses the joint over his shoulder and runs off through the wood with 
         the Little Rabbit.<br />
         <br />
         After a while the Giraffe and the Rabbit come across an Elephant about 
         to do a line of Coke. The Rabbit says, &quot;Oh, Elephant you really 
         shouldn't do that. You should come running with us in the wood. It is 
         much better for you.&quot; The Elephant looks at the Rabbit looks at the 
         line of Charlie, shrugs his shoulders, then runs off through the wood 
         with the Giraffe and the Rabbit.<br />
         <br />
         Shortly they come across a Bear about to shoot up heroin. The Rabbit 
         runs up to him and says, &quot;Hey, Bear, you shouldn't do that, think of 
         your health. You'd be better of running in the woods with us.&quot; The Bear 
         looks at the Rabbit, looks at the syringe, spoon and stuff, shrugs his 
         shoulders, kicks the whole lot away and runs off with the Rabbit, the 
         Giraffe and the Elephant.<br />
         <br />
         After a while they come across a Tiger drinking his way through a six 
         pack of beer. The Rabbit runs up to the Tiger and says, &quot;Hey Tiger, you 
         really shouldn't d that.&quot; and the Tiger immediately jumps up and starts 
         beating the living crap out of the Rabbit. The Giraffe grabs the Tiger 
         and pulls him off the Rabbit and says, &quot;What the hell are you doing, 
         man?&quot; The Tiger gets one more kick in and says, &quot;Ah, that little fucker 
         really pisses me off; he always makes me run around the bloody woods 
         when he's on Ecstasy!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
         <p>Rich man and a poor man have the same wedding 
         anniversary. They're both at Madison Avenue shopping for their wives. 
         Poor man says to the Rich man, &quot;What'd you get your wife this year?&quot; He 
         says, &quot;A Mercedes and a huge diamond ring.&quot; The poor man says, &quot;Why'd 
         you get her both?&quot; The Rich man says, &quot;If she doesn't like the ring, 
         she can take it back happy.&quot; The Poor man says, &quot;O.K. That works.&quot; The 
         Rich man says, &quot;Well what did you get your wife?&quot; The Poor man says, &quot;A 
         pair of slippers and a dildo.&quot; The Rich man says, &quot;Why'd you get her a 
         pair of slippers and a dildo?&quot; The Poor man says, &quot;If she doesn't like 
         the slippers, she can go fuck herself!&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>A gay man, finally deciding he could no longer 
         hide his sexuality from his parents, went over to their house, and 
         found his mother in the kitchen cooking dinner. He sat down at the 
         kitchen table, let out a big sigh, and said, &quot;Mom, I have something to 
         tell you: I'm gay.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         His mother made no reply or gave any response, and the guy was about to 
         repeat it to make sure she'd heard him, when she turned away from the 
         pot she was stirring and said calmly, &quot;You're gay -- doesn't that mean 
         you put other men's penises in your mouth?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         The guy said nervously, &quot;Uh, yeah, Mom, that's right.&quot; His mother went 
         back to stirring the pot, then suddenly whirled around, whacked him 
         over the head with her spoon and said, &quot;Don't you EVER complain about 
         my cooking again!!!!!&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>At the card shop: A woman was spending a long 
         time looking at the cards, finally shaking her head, &quot;No.&quot; A clerk came 
         over and asked, &quot;May I help you?&quot; &quot;I don't know,&quot; said the woman. &quot;Do 
         you have any 'Sorry I laughed at your dick' cards?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A guy calls the hospital. He says, &quot;You gotta 
         send help! My wife's going into labor!&quot; The nurse says, &quot;Calm down. Is 
         this her first child?&quot; He says, &quot;No! This is her fucking husband!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
         <p>The pretty co-ed nervously asked the doctor to 
         perform an unusual operation: the removal of a large chunk of green wax 
         from her navel. Looking up from the ticklish task, the physician asked, 
         &quot;How did this happen?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Let me put it this way, doc,&quot; the girl began. &quot;My boyfriend likes to 
         eat by candlelight.&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>One day Little Susie got her &quot;monthly bleeding&quot; 
         for the first time in her life. Having failed to understand what was 
         going on and being really frightened, she decided to share her trouble 
         with little Johnny. Having found Johnny she told and showed him what 
         her problem was. Johnny's face grew serious and he said, &quot;You know, I'm 
         not a doctor, but it looks like someone just ripped your balls off!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>&quot;Doc, I think my son has gonorrhea,&quot; a patient 
         told his urologist on the phone. &quot;The only woman he's screwed is our 
         maid.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Ok, don't be hard on him. He's just a kid,&quot; the medic soothed. &quot;Get 
         him in here right away and I'll take care of him.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;But, Doc. I've been screwing the maid too and I've got the same 
         symptoms he has.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Then you come in with him and I'll fix you both up.&quot; Replied the 
         doctor. &quot;Well,&quot; the man admitted, &quot; I think my wife<br />
         now has it too.&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Son of a bitch!&quot; the physician roared. &quot;That means we've all got it!&quot;</p>
            <hr />
            <p>A woman with really hairy underarms boards a 
         crowded bus. Unable to find a seat, she settles for hanging onto one of 
         the poles. A drunk man next to her stares at her for three minutes, 
         then tells her, &quot;I love a woman that does aerobics.&quot; The woman replies 
         angrily, &quot;I don't DO aerobics!&quot; The drunk man then looks at the woman 
         and says, &quot;Then how did you get your leg up so high?&quot;</p>
            <hr />
         <p>A guy met this girl in a bar and asked, &quot;May I 
         buy you a drink?&quot;. Looking back unimpressed at the man she replies, 
         &quot;Okay, but it won't do you any good.&quot; A little later, he asks, &quot;May I 
         buy you another drink?&quot;<br />
         <br />
         &quot;Okay, but it still won't do you any good.&quot; He invites her up to his 
         apartment and she replies, &quot;Okay, but it won't do you any good.&quot; They 
         get to his apartment and he says, &quot;You are the most beautiful thing I 
         have ever seen. I want you for my wife.&quot; She says, &quot;Oh, that's 
         different. Send her in.&quot;</p>
         <hr />
         <p>A woman sought the advice of a sex therapist, 
         confiding that she found it increasingly difficult to find a man who 
         could satisfy her, and that it was very wearisome getting in and out of 
         all these short term relationships. &quot;Isn't there some way to judge the 
         size of a man's equipment from the outside?&quot; she asked earnestly. &quot;The 
         only foolproof way, is by the size of his feet,&quot; counselled the 
         therapist. So the woman went downtown and proceeded to cruise the 
         streets, until she came across a young fellow standing in an 
         unemployment line with the biggest feet she had ever laid her eyes on. 
         She took him out to dinner, wined and dined him, and then took him back 
         to her apartment for an evening of abandon. When the man woke up the 
         next morning, the woman had already gone but, by the bedside table was 
         a $20 bill and a note that read, &quot;With my compliments, take this money 
         and go out and buy a pair of shoes that fit you.&quot;</p>
